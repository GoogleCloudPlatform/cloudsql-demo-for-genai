"Prison Link Cymru had 1,099 referrals in 2015-16 and said some ex-offenders were living rough for up to a year before finding suitable accommodation.
Workers at the charity claim investment in housing would be cheaper than jailing homeless repeat offenders.
The Welsh Government said more people than ever were getting help to address housing problems.
Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.
Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.
However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.
Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was ""chronic"".
""There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,"" he said.
""It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.
""When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.""
Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.
""The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,"" he said.
Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.
Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.
He said he would ask himself: ""Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.""
""You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.""
Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.
""You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,"" he said.
Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.
""We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,"" he said.
""I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.
""But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.
It added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.","There is a ""chronic"" need for more housing for prison leavers in Wales, according to a charity.",38264402
"The leaflets said the patient had been referred for an urgent appointment as their symptoms might indicate cancer.
East Sussex NHS Trust has put the mix-up down to an external company that distributes its printed material.
It said the wrong patient information leaflets were added to hospital appointment letters sent out in March.
It has now contacted everyone affected to apologise and explain what went wrong.
Liz Fellows, assistant director of operations at the trust, said: ""It was an administrative error and we apologise for any unnecessary anxiety this error may have caused.""
East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust covers Hastings, Eastbourne and Rother, and is responsible for the Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne District Hospital.
The trust said that due to the large number of appointment letters it sends out it uses an external printing company to print and distribute appointment letters.
It said each letter is coded to indicate any supplementary information that needs to accompany it.
Ms Fellows said: ""Unfortunately, for a short period in March, the printing company inadvertently miscoded approximately 850 letters resulting in a 'two-week information leaflet' being inserted with an appointment letter.
""As soon as the error became apparent it was stopped immediately, and letters of apology sent out.""",Hospital bosses in Sussex have apologised after about 850 patients were sent leaflets in error suggesting they might have cancer.,32672009

Doull emulated fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas, who won at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, by helping Great Britain win team pursuit gold in world record time.
The 23-year-old joined record-breaking Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to beat the world champions.
""That was just surreal, it feels dreamlike"" said the Cardiff rider.

""We've been in situations like that before when we've been so close and have lost so to pull it off now is unbelievable.""
He had previously won silver medals at the 2015 and 2016 World Championship - this year to the Australian team - but Doull earned Olympic redemption to add to the four Welsh silver medallists in Rio.
""I've dreamt of this moment for so long,"" added Doull.
""It's what gets you out of the bed in the morning. I've pictured crossing that line first and winning the Olympics and to finally be here and do it, it's just surreal. It's a culmination of four years of hard work.""
Swimmer Jazz Carlin, rower Victoria Thornley and rugby sevens players Sam Cross and James Davies had already enjoyed podium finishes before Doull secured Wales' seventh gold in the last three Olympics.
Wales had not won an Olympic title in 36 years when Nicole Cooke stormed to women's road race gold in 2008 - the first Welsh cycling medal ever at an Olympics.
But since Cooke's win in Beijing, Wales have won three more cycling gold medals - and could win a fifth on Saturday when Elinor Barker will help the British world record holding women bid for team pursuit gold.
Doull - who started cycling at the Maindy Fliers club in Cardiff like Thomas and Barker - had helped the Great Britain team to lower the world record in their heat demolition of New Zealand.
But Team GB were quickly behind in Friday's final as Australia led by 0.7 seconds at the halfway mark, before GB reeled them in and then pulled away in the final 500m to win the 4km race by 0.83 seconds - in a world record time of three minutes, 50.265 seconds.
Doull's team-mate Wiggins became the first Briton to win eight Olympic medals - five golds, one silver and two bronzes - as GB won a third successive team pursuit Olympic title.
""It gives you such confidence....you've got Brad on my right behind me and I've got Burke and Ed down below me,"" said Doull.
""It's Burke's second Olympic title in his discipline, it's Ed's third and he's the most decorated Yorkshireman, so he keeps telling me, so to have that calibre of team is just massive and it gives you such confidence.""",Owain Doull has won Wales' first gold of the 2016 Olympics as  he helped the Great Britain men's team pursuit defend their cycling title in Rio.,37066439
"We received that question from Drew who is planning a trip to New York in December. He asked: ""Should I get my cash now or should I wait? Will there be much change between now and then?""
Anthony Reuben, from BBC Reality Check, had this answer: ""The BBC does not give financial advice, but here are a few things to bear in mind...
""The exchange rate between the pound and the dollar reflects the views of investors about the relative strengths of the two economies.
""Since the Brexit vote in June the pound has fallen about 18% against the dollar on the judgment that growth is likely to be stronger in the US than the UK and that UK interest rates are falling while the next movement in US rates is expected to be upwards.
""But it's always possible that something could happen to change that view - there is a presidential election in the US in November, for example. The outcome of that could make a considerable difference to the exchange rate.
""You do not necessarily have to put all your eggs in one basket - there is also the option to hedge your bets and buy half of your dollars now and half of them just before you go, as long as you are not going to be hit by extra charges for carrying out two transactions.
""It is always worth shopping around when buying currency - avoid buying your currency at the last minute at the airport. There are plenty of comparison sites online that will help you get the most dollars possible for your pounds, even if it is fewer than you would have got a few months ago.""
We asked readers to send in questions about the recent fall of the pound and rise of the FTSE 100.
Anthony chose Drew's question: ""I'm planning on going to New York in December, should I get my cash now or wait? Will there be much change between now and then?""

"Only 50.5 overs were possible at the MCG, but Australia still got wickets at regular intervals with Jackson Bird taking two for 53.

"The Alabama Securities Commission led the investigation, which helps prevent financial fraud against the elderly.
After an agent interviewed Lee, the commission's head said he was satisfied she wanted a second book published.
The new work - Go Set a Watchman - will be the 88-year-old American author's first release since the 1960s.
The surprise move prompted some suggestions Lee was manipulated into publishing the decades-old manuscript, which was discovered by her lawyer in the author's possessions last year.
""We closed the file. Let's just say that she was able to answer questions we asked to our satisfaction from our point of view,'' said Joseph Borg, Alabama Securities Commission director.
The New York Times reported that the investigation was sparked by requests from a doctor that the state investigate whether Lee was capable to have consented to the release of the work.
Lee herself was ""extremely hurt"" by allegations she was manipulated, her lawyer Tonja Carter said.
To Kill a Mockingbird was published in July 1960 and has sold more than 40 million copies around the world.

In an interview with Football Focus, the Argentine, 31, revealed the shock of his diagnosis last year and the subsequent support from his team-mates.
""It was really emotional to be back,"" he said. ""I feel born again and like I'm enjoying things for the first time.
""Of course, now I want to prove I can still be a Premier League player.""
Gutierrez had an operation to remove his left testicle in September 2014 after the discovery of a tumour, before undergoing chemotherapy.
He made his return to the Newcastle first team for the 1-0 defeat by Manchester United on 4 March as a substitute.
Gutierrez, who joined the Magpies from Real Mallorca in July 2008, is out of contract in the summer but is just focused on playing regularly again for the time being.
""I know my situation here is a little tricky,"" he said. ""The one thing I can do is work hard and do my best.
""I want to stay in England and I love the Premier League, but I don't know about the future.
""At present, I am with Newcastle and have two months to finish the season. When the season finishes, I start thinking about the future.""
The full interview with Jonas Gutierrez can be seen on Saturday's Football Focus at 1130 (GMT) and below are some of the highlights.
""When they told me I had cancer, it was a shock. I remember I was with the Newcastle doctor and I started crying,"" said Gutierrez.
""I went to my house to speak to my dad and he thought I was making a joke with him. He didn't realise and believe what I was telling him.""
He added: ""Chemotherapy is a hard treatment. I was just thinking after each session it was a day less I had to recover.
""I received a lot of support. To be back and train, do what you love, is another thing that makes you recover quickly.""
""It was really emotional to be back. It was good to have a first step a few days before against Aston Villa and be on the bench,"" said Gutierrez.
""When I came on against United, I could just focus on the game. It was unbelievable and to get the armband was a great touch.

"According to three separate analyses, a flood of automated comments to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was detected over the weekend.
More than 400,000 comments with remarkably similar wording have been detected in recent days.
Net neutrality proponents argue that all internet traffic should be equal.
This means that no content provider should be able to, for example, charge more for faster access to certain data.
One expert described bot activity as a new form of protest.
""Someone has gone out of their way to make these seem like real submissions,"" wrote Chris Sinchok in a blog post about the apparently automated activity.
Having downloaded the comments and associated data, Mr Sinchok noticed that the names and email addresses associated with thousands of them also turned up in lists of personal data stolen from websites.
He told the BBC that this suggested someone might be using information collected from breached databases to make the submissions look more authentic.
""It really seems like this is getting pooled from some place in an automated fashion and it's coming in at unreasonable rates,"" he said.
He added that the uniformity of the data was also a possible giveaway.
For example, many comments are essentially identical save for the occasional, small difference - such as the exact same sentence appearing in multiple comments, but with different letters capitalised each time.
And the rate at which comments were posted also seemed suspicious, starting and stopping in bursts, he added.
Other watchers, including a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and another at Harvard University, have also tracked a boom in apparently automated activity directed at the site in recent days.
Earlier this month, the FCC said it had been targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that led to downtime for the comments system.
This followed a television appearance by comedian John Oliver in which he urged people to post comments against the proposals on the FCC's website.
""Net neutrality is such a hot-button issue and it's one of the few examples of online activism that's actually amounted to something,"" noted Prof Phil Howard at the Oxford Internet Institute.
He cited the 2014 online protests, after which President Obama stepped in to recommend that the FCC drop earlier proposals to curtail net neutrality.
""This is how people protest these days,"" said Prof Howard, referring to the apparently automated comments.
He also pointed out that a growing number of people had the necessary programming skills to do it.
However, Mr Sinchok is concerned that the bot activity will create the impression that genuine opposition to the FCC's current proposals does not really exist.
""There are people that care about this issue a lot,"" he told the BBC.
""Activity like this is really muddying the waters - and I don't want it to give [the FCC] an excuse to say, 'Hey, there's mixed support for this.'""
The FCC has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.","Bots appear to be spamming a US regulator's website over a proposed reversal of net neutrality rules, researchers have said.",39950399

"The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed.
Runways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.
About 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.
Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.
The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.
However, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.
IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.
By comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.
Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.
Stratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.
Along with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.
In contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.
After the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.
However, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.
Satellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.",Satellite images of Mosul have revealed how fighters from so-called Islamic State (IS) have destroyed much of the city's airport to render it unusable as Iraqi forces close in.,37936530
"The Egypt-backed plan had envisaged a regional forum which analysts say might have forced Israel to reveal whether or not it has nuclear weapons.
The proposal was blocked by the US, the UK and Canada. The next review is set for  2020.
Israel neither confirms nor denies it has a stockpile of nuclear weapons.
Speaking after four weeks of negotiations, US Under-Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller accused Egypt and other Arab countries of ""not willing to let go of these unrealistic and unworkable conditions"" for future talks.
She also said some participants tried to ""cynically manipulate"" the whole process.
But Egypt warned that the failure to reach a deal ""will have consequences in front of the Arab world and public opinion"", the Associated Press news agency reports.
Last month, Egypt had proposed to stage a regional conference - with or without Israel's participation and without an agreed agenda.
Some analysts suggested that this move might have forced Israel - which is not a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) - to publicly clarify its position on nuclear weapons.

"The reactor at Yongbyon has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.
The White House said North Korea should ""focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations"".
The reactor was shut down in 2007 as part of a disarmament-for-aid deal.
But Pyongyang vowed to restart it in 2013, following its third nuclear test and amid high regional tensions.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the international community would not accept North Korea as a nuclear state.
""We will work with our partners in the context of the six-party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they have made,"" he said.
""We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from the irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tension and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.""
Six-nation talks involving South Korea, the US, China, Japan and Russia aimed at ending the North's nuclear programme have been stalled since 2009.
Experts believe that, when fully operational, the Yongbyon reactor can make one nuclear bomb's worth of plutonium per year.
A US think-tank said this year that satellite images suggested work had started at the Yongbyon complex.
But Tuesday's announcement was the first official confirmation from North Korea that it had restarted operations there.
The state-run news agency KCNA said North Korea was improving its nuclear weapons ""in quality and quantity"".
It said that the North was ready to face US hostility with ""nuclear weapons any time"".
However, experts say North Korea's nuclear capabilities are unclear.
Pyongyang claims it has made a device small enough to fit a nuclear warhead on to a missile, which it could launch at its enemies. But US officials have cast doubt on the claim.
North Korea has made bellicose threats against its neighbours and the US before, often to coincide with annual joint military exercises held by South Korea and US forces.

The woman has agreed to make a payment of Â£40 to an armed forces charity.

In a statement, the CPS outlined details of the offence but did not name the newspaper or the barracks.

The tournament kicks off with France playing Romania on Friday, 10 June and the final will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on 10 July. Spain are hoping to retain the title they won in 2008 and 2012.
England will be appearing at their ninth finals, while Wales and Northern Ireland have qualified for the first time.
Good question - because, for the first time, there are 24 teams competing in the finals. That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.
With six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers. In other words, only eight teams will fail to qualify from the group stage.
One point could be enough to put your team into the last 16 - and from then the tournament goes to a knockout format.
As Greece proved by pulling off a sensational triumph at Euro 2004, trying to predict a winner is a difficult game.
World champions Germany are understandably one of the favourites, while holders Spain are also short odds with the bookmakers.
Germany finished top of their qualification group but booking their place in France was not without its hiccups - with defeats by Poland and the Republic of Ireland. They have been beaten by France and England since qualifying but remain one to watch.
Spain dominated international football between 2008 and 2012 but failed to qualify from their group at the 2014 World Cup. Could this be a last hurrah for Vicente del Bosque's ageing but brilliant side?
France won the World Cup as hosts in 1998 - can they repeat the famous success of the team led by Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane and Laurent Blanc?
A run into the latter stages by Les Bleus is likely to help restore national morale in a country still recovering from last year's deadly Paris attacks.
France are the bookmakers' favourites to win the whole thing, but their form is tricky to gauge because they did not have to qualify for this tournament.
Fast on the counter and unified after years of internal division, watch out for talented midfielders Paul Pogba and Blaise Matuidi.
But they cannot call upon prolific Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. The French Football Federation (FFF) said he would not be picked after being investigated for his part in an alleged plot to blackmail Les Bleus team-mate Mathieu Valbuena, who did not make the squad.
Well, there are three of them in France - only Scotland missed out - plus the Republic of Ireland. It is going to get crowded too, because England and Wales are both in Group B, along with Russia and debutants Slovakia.
Don't expect much work to get done when England and Wales play each other - that match in Lens will be shown live on BBC One, kick-off 14:00 BST, on Thursday, 16 June.
Roy Hodgson's England have a good young team but doubts persist about their defence. They breezed through their qualifying group with a perfect record of 10 wins, while confidence was further boosted with March's impressive win away at world champions Germany.
Wales have got Real Madrid star Gareth Bale and plenty of heart. Chris Coleman's side reached their first major tournament in 57 years after losing just once in qualification.
Northern Ireland might have numerous players from England's lower leagues but they finished top of their qualifying group, losing just one of their 10 matches.
Striker Kyle Lafferty could not get a game for club side Norwich during qualifying (he has since been loaned to Birmingham) but he scored seven crucial goals in nine games for his country.
With the 24-team format offering hope to traditionally less-successful nations, five countries have taken advantage to secure their European Championship finals debut.
Northern Ireland and Wales, of course, are two of them.
Slovakia, who have been drawn alongside England and Wales in Group B, have qualified for the first time as an independent state. A 1-0 win against Spain showed the 2010 World Cup qualifiers can mix it with Europe's elite. Beware England and Wales.
Albania have never been near a major finals, but edged out Denmark - the 1992 champions - in their qualifying group thanks to a shock win in Portugal. Oh, and because they were awarded a 3-0 win in Serbia by the Court of Arbitration for Sport after a riot.
With a population of roughly 330,000 (comparable to Coventry) and only 21,508 registered players, Iceland are unsurprisingly the smallest nation to ever qualify for the finals.
How did they do that? By beating the Netherlands - 1988 winners and three-time semi-finalists - home and away during qualifying. The Dutch, for the first time since 1984, will not be there.
Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who was voted the world's second best player behind Argentina's Lionel Messi in the 2015 Ballon d'Or vote, heads a star-studded cast.
Ronaldo will be leading Portugal's challenge, while Wales hope his club-mate Gareth Bale - the world's most expensive player - can transform his impressive La Liga form onto the international stage.
World Cup winners Germany boast a host of stellar names who have impressed in previous tournaments, most notably Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and forward Thomas Muller plus Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos.
France's challenge is set to be driven by energetic Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, who is still reportedly courting the attention of several English Premier League sides.
Belgium are not short of star quality either. Premier League pair Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne will spearhead their quest for a first major tournament win, but the Red Devils are without injured captain Vincent Kompany.
And Sweden superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic, 34, will be hoping to illuminate an international tournament for what could be the final time.
The Netherlands' failure to qualify leaves Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben watching from home, while his club-mate Franck Ribery was not named in the France squad, despite suggestions he was considering ending his international retirement.
The tournament's 51 games will be staged at 10 locations across France, including new stadiums in Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon and Nice.
The opening match - between France and Romania on 10 June - and the 10 July final will be played at the Stade de France in Paris.
Building the new venues and renovating historic grounds such as Marseille's Stade Velodrome has cost 1.6bn euros (£1.2bn) - modernisation which was necessary, organisers say, because France did not fully capitalise on hosting the 1998 World Cup.

In March this year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) ratified a host of revisions to the laws of the game in an attempt to remove inconsistencies and meet the needs of the modern game. The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.
More than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:
Kick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.
Pre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.
Leaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.
The end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.
Goalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.
Yes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.
However, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.

Each of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones. The fan zones will have a giant screen for showing all of the matches throughout the tournament.
The biggest will be in Paris, where up to 90,000 supporters can gather on the Champ de Mars - in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.
You won't miss a kick.
The BBC and ITV will bring audiences closer to the heart of the action than ever before with extensive coverage of Euro 2016.
The BBC will showcase 26 live matches on TV and streamed online within its 140 hours of programming, including highlights on BBC One, BBC Two and the Red Button plus 24 days of coverage on Radio 5 live.
The BBC's Euro 2016 digital service will feature live broadcasts of all BBC games, commentary and live text coverage of every game featuring in-game highlight clips, on-demand highlights of every goal, breaking news, exclusive features and expert analysis.

"They held private meetings with Theresa May in the wake of the Hillsborough inquests, which ended in April.
Jurors found the fans who died as a result of the 1989 crush were unlawfully killed.
The families also complained about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police.
They called on the home secretary to put the force into remedial measures.
It is understood the proposed 'Hillsborough Law' would seek to place a further onus on those in public office to cooperate positively with investigations.
The families were told about developments in two ongoing criminal investigations into the disaster at the meetings with the home secretary, which were held in Warrington.
Theresa May has previously praised the dignity and determination of the victims' relatives.
Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said: ""I myself for the very first time felt - I'm sure the families did as well - that at last there's a home secretary that's actually listening to them.""
The home secretary has met some Hillsborough families before, but this is the first time that she's spoken directly to them since the inquests ended.
Theresa May spent several hours in Warrington, meeting separately with the two main groups of relatives.
The atmosphere was said to be heated, with some of the families complaining directly to her about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police during the inquests.
Some relatives asked for assurances that there will be criminal prosecutions, and I'm told that they wanted to make sure that the home secretary personally understood the emotional toll that the two-year inquests have taken.
Although the Hillsborough families welcomed the jury's finding of unlawful killing, they know that many months of uncertainty lie ahead before they find out whether criminal trials will follow.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that 19 people have refused to assist with their probe into the conduct of officers from West Midlands Police, which investigated the tragedy.
The watchdog has now handed files on suspects to the Crown Prosecution Service in its largest-ever inquiry into alleged criminality and alleged police misconduct.
The IPCC has contacted 258 officers and staff members involved in the investigation into the tragedy and a total of 161 statements have been taken.
The watchdog said: ""Our intention remains to submit full files of evidence to the CPS by the turn of the year to enable decisions to be made on whether any individuals should be charged.""","Relatives of the 96 people who died at Hillsborough have told the home secretary they want a ""Hillsborough Law"" to compel public officials to tell the truth at inquiries.",36438606

"But there was nothing expected about the way his Manchester United side claimed their first away win of the season.
""If Arsenal had scored in the first 20 minutes then it is a different game,"" said the United boss. ""And then maybe I have to respond to all the questions asking why I chose the three centre-backs. But now I can laugh.""
The joke ended up being on Arsenal's attacking players rather than the unlikely trio of defenders that Van Gaal had picked - Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair - who surprisingly held out until Olivier Giroud's ferocious strike in stoppage time.
Saturday evening's defeat was not the same old story for the Gunners either - they did not take the lead this time, for starters.
And while we already knew that both teams are unlikely to mount a title challenge, there were still things to be learned from a game billed as the battle for fourth place.

It had taken United until the 85th minute to muster a shot on target, with Kieran Gibbs' bizarre own goal gifting them the lead before Wayne Rooney's late strike prevented the game finishing with that odd statistic.
As well as his first away win as United boss, this was arguably the first win under Van Gaal that had been earned by his defence.
Arsene Wenger was keen to point out that David De Gea was man of the match at Emirates Stadium but in truth the United keeper made a lot of saves he would be expected to make, rather than any truly outstanding ones.
Or as Van Gaal put it: ""Most of his saves were from outside the area and from that distance the goalkeeper has more advantage than the player shooting.""
The biggest reason De Gea's recently dislocated finger was not truly tested was United's makeshift backline, something few people expected to be saying before this game when they saw the team sheet with the names of Smalling, McNair and Blackett on it.
A fourth clean sheet of the season looked even less likely when one of the wing-backs, Luke Shaw, was forced off after 16 minutes to be replaced by Ashley Young - who according to his manager is not fully fit.
At that stage, Arsenal were rampant and it seemed a case of when they would score, not if. But instead of collapsing, United stood firm.
Smalling, who is not viewed as natural leader, marshalled the youngsters either side of him. In front of them, Michael Carrick and Marouane Fellaini added much-needed bite to midfield.
Together they earned Van Gaal a win that moved his side up to fourth in the table - something he seemed surprised about when he was told.
While United can - justifiably - claim to be making progress, the raw statistics demonstrate Arsenal are going backwards.
A year ago, they beat Southampton 2-0 and were four points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 12 games.
Fast forward 12 months and Wenger's men have 11 points fewer at the same stage, and trail leaders Chelsea by 15 points.
Yes, fourth place is still in their reach - United, in the last of the Champions League places, are only two points ahead. Framed like that, this campaign is not yet a disaster.

But after ending their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup, and following that up with a summer of heavy investment, Arsenal fans can be forgiven for thinking their title challenge should have lasted longer than it did last season, when it faded in the New Year.
Instead it is all but over before most people have put their Christmas decorations up.
Some are making their frustrations heard - such as the Gunners fan in front of the press box on Saturday who held aloft a sign reading ""Enough is Enough - Wenger out"".
But the majority remained with their manager on this occasion, perhaps because this defeat was unlike most of their setbacks this season.
This time, it was misfortune that cost them the initiative in a game, rather than any ill-advised attempts to extend their lead.
Gibbs' collision with Wojciech Szczesny that led to the full-back's own goal and ended the keeper's involvment in the game was pure farce.
It would be unkind to compare the duo's actions to the antics of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, the stars of new film 'Dumb and Dumber To' who were at Emirates Stadium to watch the game.
But you get the feeling their characters Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne would definitely have approved.
United's second goal was much more familiar to Arsenal fans, with their team being caught up the pitch and exposed on the break - but at least this time it was because they were chasing the game.
Wenger's team have obvious shortcomings but they were not behind this defeat and his side did not get what they deserved against United. Instead it was just one of those nights.","Perhaps predictably, Louis van Gaal delivered the best line of the day as he reflected on how his side survived an early storm to beat Arsenal 2-1.",30165675

""I was disappointed with the autumn series, in particular against Australia,"" said Roberts.
Roberts acknowledges he ""deserved"" to be dropped for his performance against the Wallabies.
""It was a bad day at the office and I paid the price for it,"" he said.
""Hopefully that's given me a kick up the backside to go again, and in the Six Nations it was disappointing not to get a shot at starting.""
With 12 Wales players in the Lions squad, Roberts will lead a squad including 13 uncapped players.
It will be his first experience of captaining a side since he led Cardiff Schools Under-15s.
Wales' first Test is part of an Auckland double-header on Friday, 16 June, with their game against Tonga preceding New Zealand's match against Samoa.

"According to organisers a record 3.6 million turned out to vote in the Scottish independence referendum.
More than 100,000 of the total were 16 to 17-year-olds who had registered to vote.
Erin Fyfe McWilliam, 16 said: ""I'm glad the government thought we were able to make decisions for our country.""
She thinks it's put young people in the spotlight: ""Usually the older generation see us as being the 'tallywags' who don't care about politics at all.
""But I do think this referendum has taught the younger generation a lot about politics.""
A survey, commissioned by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, said 71% of 16 to 17-year-olds voted for Scotland to be independent and 29% voted against.
So even if the age-group contributed their political views, it didn't appear to influence the outcome.
Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom after the ""No"" campaign won.
The Scottish referendum was a one-off for 16 and 17-year-olds, after the Scottish Parliament passed legislation allowing it to happen.
But for years youth campaign groups have been trying to get the UK voting age lowered, arguing you can get married at 16 and pay your taxes, so why not vote?
Gaelan Miller 17, who voted in the referendum, agreed that he didn't have that much life experience but said that shouldn't matter.
""Sometimes I think young folk like me can be influenced by your parents and we don't have mortgages,"" he said.
""But that's not to say we can't look at statistics at what's happened before with mortgages and ask your parents questions.""
The Lib Dems are all for 16 and 17-year-olds voting and promised it in their 2010 manifesto.
Labour leader, Ed Miliband, also backs lowering the age.
UKIP are against it, the Green Party is for and the Scottish National Party (SNP) is in favour as well.
David Cameron and the Tories oppose it, so until all the parties agree to debate the issue it's unlikely to happen.
Senior Lib Dem minister and Scottish MP, Danny Alexander, told Newsbeat he believes young people ""bring a freshness to the debate and ask important questions"".
He said: ""I've always believed that 16 to 17-year-olds should have the vote.
""Some of the best debates and discussion I have had about the Scottish referendum have been with young people in schools and Newsbeat's Big Debate.""
But when asked about lowering the voting age before the next General election in May 2015, he was less optimistic.
""Not every party wants that so that we will have to look at that. We need to build a consensus across all parties for that happen. So we could have debate the constitutional changes in the UK,"" the chief of the Treasury said.
""All parties have to agree to do that. But I think the time has come for reform.""
17-year-old Erin added: ""It's a bit disappointing being given this opportunity, then being told a few months down the line you have to wait a few years. I think it should be changed so that 16 and 17 year olds can vote.""
In the last general election in 2010, fewer than half of all 18 to 24-year-olds voted, which was much lower than the national average.

"The regulator has agreed to increase the amount of weight graphite bricks at the core of the reactor at Dungeness B in Kent will be allowed to lose.
The bricks, which degrade over time due to radiation, are vital for safety.
The Office for Nuclear Regulation said it was a ""robust"" body but one expert accused it of ""moving the goalposts"".
The nuclear reactor at Dungeness B would have breached the safety margin within months which could have forced the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to prosecute or even shut it down.
The safety margins cover thousands of graphite bricks at the core of Britain's 14 elderly Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs).
But the bricks, each about a metre in height, are both cracking and starting to lose weight due to decades of radiation, and that could affect safety.
The current graphite weight loss limit for Dungeness is set at 6.2% but the regulator says when it reached 5.7% its operator, French power giant EDF, applied to raise it to 8%.
Mark Foy, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said ""We will be in a position to agree that 8% limit within the next few weeks. Ageing is a nuclear safety issue"".
As part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly.
Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: ""It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.""
Mr Foy stressed that the ONR was a ""robust regulator"" and due process had been followed.
""If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,"" he said.
The graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them.
The bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material.
A distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency.
EDF said ""safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority"" and the company took a ""cautious approach"" working closely with the regulator and they operated with ""very conservative safety margins"" and safety requirements were ""stringent"".
But in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit.
Prof Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were ""conservative.""
But he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be ""uneconomic"" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety.
""They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,"" he said.
It was an ""engineering judgement"", he said, but ""no one could be sure"".
""There was more weight loss than expected in Dungeness B and that has led to some uncertainty about the continued operation.""
The AGR reactors contribute about 15% of Britain's electricity, according to Prof Thomas.
He said EDF wanted the old AGR reactors to last until the planned next generation of nuclear power stations came on line after 2023 but said it was reaching a ""crunch point"".
The old reactors might not last as long as EDF would like and there were still real doubts about the plans to build the new reactor at Hinkley C in Somerset.","A key safety limit at one of Britain's nuclear power stations is being raised to allow the life of the reactor to be extended, the BBC has learned.",27691207
"She took power over the weekend following the death of 78-year-old President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office after heading up the southern Africa country since 2004.
Mr Mutharika's decision to appoint her as his running mate for the 2009 elections surprised many in Malawi's mainly conservative, male-dominated society - which had never before had a female vice-president.
Equally surprising was her decision to publicly stand up to her boss - by refusing to endorse his plans for his brother, Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mutharika, to succeed him as president in 2014 when he was due to retire.
She was promptly thrown out of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party - and subjected to daily doses of derision at public rallies and on Malawi's state airwaves.
A senior ruling party official openly said Malawi was ""not ready for a female president"", while First Lady Callista Mutharika said Mrs Banda was fooling herself that she was a serious politician - saying she was a mere market woman selling fritters.
""She will never be president, how can a mandasi [fritter] seller be president?"" Mrs Mutharika said.
Mrs Banda took all this in her stride, saying she was glad to be identified with market women since more than 80% of Malawian women belong to that category: ""Yes, she's right, I'm indeed a mandasi seller and I'm proud of it because the majority of women in Malawi are like us, mandasi sellers.""
She also resisted calls for her to resign as the country's vice-president - she was elected not appointed so she could not be fired by Mr Mutharika - and instead set up her own People's Party.
Born in 1950 in the village of Malemia near the southern town of Zomba, Joyce Hilda Ntila was the eldest in a family of five children.
Her father was the leader of Malawi's police brass band and her youngest sister, Anjimile, ran pop star Madonna's charity Raising Malawi until it closed in December.
She left her first husband in 1981, taking her three children with her, because he was abusive.
""Most African women are taught to endure abusive marriages. They say endurance means a good wife but most women endure abusive relationship because they are not empowered economically, they depend on their husbands,"" she told the BBC about her decision.
Eight years later, Mrs Banda founded the National Association of Business Women, a group that lends start-up cash to small-scale traders - making her popular among Malawi's many rural poor.
That work also earned her international recognition - in 1997, she was awarded, along with former Mozambican President Joachim Chissano, the US-based Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger.
She also set up the Joyce Banda Foundation, a charity that assists Malawian children and orphans through education - she has a degree in early childhood education.
Joyce Banda cut her teeth in politics in 1999 when she won a parliamentary seat on the ticket of the former ruling United Democratic Front.
She held a number of cabinet positions under former President Bakili Muluzi and Mr Mutharika during his first term.
She puts her achievements down to her happy marriage to retired Chief Justice Richard Banda with whom she has two children.
""My dear husband, Richard, has been the driving force behind my success and rise to whatever level I am now. My story and legacy is incomplete without his mention,"" she said.
Mrs Banda's presidential challenges are huge: Aside from handling political divisions and possible opposition from Mr Mutharika's allies, she has to address Malawi's serious economic difficulties.
It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with an estimated 75% of the population living on less than $1 (60p) a day.
And former President Mutharika fell out with most of Western donors - on which the country depends for financial support.
The cutting off of direct aid resulted in the country's worst shortages of foreign currency, fuel and essential drugs.
But she has immediately made her mark - sacking Malawi's police chief Peter Mukhito, accused of mishandling anti-government riots last year in which at least 19 people were shot dead, and Patricia Kaliati as information minister.
In the wake of Mr Mutharika's death, Ms Kaliati had held a press conference saying Mrs Banda had no right to take over as president - despite what the constitution said.
The head of Malawi's state broadcaster has also been replaced.","Joyce Banda, who has made history becoming Malawi's first female president and only the second woman to lead a country in Africa, has a track record of fighting for women's rights.",17662916
"It comes amid reports of several race-related incidents over the weekend.
""Racist"" graffiti was found scrawled on a Polish cultural centre in Hammersmith, west London, the Met said.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had asked Scotland Yard to be ""extra vigilant"" following the reports.
The Polish ambassador to Britain Witold Sobkow expressed shock at what he called incidents of ""xenophobic abuse"" directed against the Polish community.
He said: ""The Polish Embassy is in contact with relevant institutions and local police are already investigating the two most widely reported cases in Hammersmith, London, and Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.
""We call on all Polish nationals who fall victim of xenophobic abuse and on all witnesses to report such incidents to local authorities.""
He also thanked the British public for messages of support and solidarity the Polish community had received.
Police are investigating the vandalism at Hammersmith's Polish community building after images on social media appeared to show offensive graffiti smeared in yellow paint across the entrance. It was later removed.
Cambridgeshire Police are also investigating suspected post-referendum racism after notes were allegedly posted through letterboxes of Polish residents in the county.
Laminated cards reading ""leave the EU - no more Polish vermin"" were reportedly delivered to members of the Polish community in Huntingdon, north west of Cambridge, on Saturday.
Other incidents were also reported on social media, while a hashtag of #PostRefRacism was being used on Twitter.
Sky News journalist Adam Boulton tweeted: ""This weekend I and my family have witnessed 3 ""when are you going home?"" Racist incidents aimed at EU citizens here.""
Another user, James Titcombe, tweeted: ""Daughter tells me someone wrote '[Child's name] go back to Romania' on the wall in the girls toilets at School today"".
And former Conservative party deputy chairwoman Baroness Warsi also tweeted a string of reports of racist incidents, saying: ""This is not the post Brexit Britain we want to see. Politicians from all sides need to speak out ""
The Muslim Council of Britain said there had been countless incidents reported in the days since the referendum result as well as shocking manifestations of hate speech both online and also on the streets of Britain.
They included a demonstration outside a Birmingham mosque and reports of Muslims and others being told to ""go back home"", it said.
It called on political and civic leaders to urgently come together and heal the divisions that had emerged as a result of the referendum campaign.
Dr. Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: ""Now we are witnessing the shocking extent of this with reports around the country of hate speech and minorities being targeted. We need leadership now more than ever before.""
Mr Khan echoed those sentiments calling on ""all Londoners to pull together and rally behind this great city.""

"Ahead of a Westminster debate on the abuse faced by MPs, Labour claimed the Tories had run a ""negative, nasty campaign"" targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott in particular.
It comes after Theresa May suggested Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to condemn abuse.
The PM has called for parties to unite against ""bullying and harassment"".
Since last month's general election, attention has focused on abuse suffered by MPs from across the political spectrum, including Tory Sheryll Murray who said she had faced social media comments like ""burn the witch"".
On Saturday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said some of her party's supporters had targeted female Conservative MPs - as well as Labour members - with ""vitriolic abuse"".
But ahead of the Parliamentary debate, Labour has levelled accusations against the Tories in a letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin from his Labour counterpart Ian Lavery and Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement.
""Parties and politicians have a responsibility to set an example, by treating others with dignity and respect, including those with whom we strongly disagree,"" they wrote.
""The Conservative Party has instead promoted personal attacks as a core component of its national campaign.
""Abuse against candidates on social media is completely unacceptable. The Conservative Party perpetrated this on an industrial scale by spending millions of pounds to post highly personalised and nasty attack adverts on voters' Facebook timelines without their permission.""
They claimed Labour ""fought a positive, hopeful campaign"" and insisted that all its MPs ran campaigns based on its policies rather than personal attacks.
On Monday, Mrs May - asked whether Mr Corbyn was doing enough in response to complaints of intimidation - said she was ""surprised at any party leader who's not willing to condemn that"".
Conservative Simon Hart has secured Wednesday afternoon's Westminster Hall debate on ""the abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections"".
Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics on Tuesday, Mr Hart said there had been a clear change in attitudes towards MPs and campaigners between the 2015 and 2017 general elections.
People wanting to publicly support candidates were being ""driven away from politics at a time when we need them"" he said.
""This extends way beyond the so-called bullying of MPs, this is about online bullying generally,"" he said, claiming there had been a ""deafening silence"" from political leaders.
Mr Hart claimed the emergence of Jeremy Corbyn-backing grassroots organisation Momentum had played a ""significant part"" in this shift.
But Momentum dismissed his accusation as ""baseless"".
""If we are going to tackle the abuse MPs from across the political spectrum face, Simon Hart and other Conservative MPs should stop making baseless accusations for which they offer no proof, and instead think about how we can work together to find a solution,"" a spokesman for the group said.","Labour has accused the Conservatives of putting ""vitriolic personal attacks"" at the heart of their election campaign.",40577325
"At an event in Hove, the prime minister said all good schools should be able to expand and his government had supported that right.
The Weald of Kent girls' grammar school wants to open an annexe in Sevenoaks.
The Department for Education (DfE) is considering the plans which have the backing of Kent County Council.
The law forbids the opening of new grammar schools, but changes made by the coalition government in 2012 allow enlargement of existing schools.
""I strongly support the right of all good schools to expand. I think that's very important and that should include grammar schools,"" the prime minister said:
""Under this government grammar schools have been able to expand and that is all to the good.""
Mr Cameron was responding to a question about the the proposed satellite grammar school in Sevenoaks.
But he would not be drawn on when the government was likely to make its decision.
""As for the decision that the Department for Education has to take, they have to take that having [looked] at all the evidence and after having proper consultations and making the decision in proper time,"" he added.
Sevenoaks is the only major Kent town that does not have grammar provision.
Bids made in 2013 were turned down because the DfE said they did not comply with the law.
But the current plans put forward by Weald of Kent girls' grammar school are believed to have met the criteria.
If approved, the annexe could pave the way for more grammars to open satellite campuses.

"It's perceived as the least corrupt country, with the longest surviving multiparty democracy on the continent, and boasts one of the world's fastest-growing economies.
But, following the global economic downturn in 2008, and increasingly volatile commodity prices, the country's reliance on diamonds has come into question.
For the first time Botswana finds itself cash strapped, in negative growth, and having to go to international donors.
The country is looking to diversify its economy by strengthening existing sectors like tourism and cattle farming, and investing in burgeoning industries spawning from technology and entrepreneurship.
Yet diamonds by far outshine any other industry in Botswana, accounting for one-third of GDP, 70% of export earnings, and about one-third of the government's revenues.
However, production has peaked, and experts believe reserves of the precious stone may run out by 2030.
Unemployment is also on the rise, with official jobless rates nearing 20%, and an estimated 45% of Botswana's population living below the poverty line.
Economic growth was also negative in 2009, and the industrial sector shrank by 30%.
Signs of labour unrest have also began showing following public sector strikes in recent years.
As Linah Mohohlo, who has been governor of the Bank of Botswana for 15 years, put it in a recent interview with BBC Africa Business Report: ""It is a serious concern to government, for many years now strategies have been put in place to diversify the economy away from mining.""
In many ways Botswana is seen as becoming a victim of its own making.
Policies have favoured and protected the diamond industry, and strategies and institutions that assisted and protected its growth for decades have made implementation and expansion of newer, alternative industries difficult.
The strong role of the state in the economy, plus bloated bureaucracy, often also makes it difficult for investors to enter the market.
Most contracts are also government sponsored, making it hard for entrepreneurs to set up shop and compete.
Despite being in the relatively stable southern African region, an electricity crisis in South Africa, and political uncertainty in Zimbabwe makes it a bit of a rough neighbourhood.
In response Ms Mohohlo says she's more worried about competition from the country's neighbours, especially for foreign direct investment, and says Botswana needs to ""sharpen its pencils"".
The manufacturing industry, for example, has ""not done what we expected it to do"", she says. The sector accounts for an estimated 5% of Botswana's GDP, and employs more labour than mining.
In addition, Botswana has a small domestic market of only two million people and having to compete head-to-head with South Africa is a challenge.
Botswana needs to come up with unique enterprises to compete effectively with South Africa, says Dr Tebogo Seleka, executive director of the Botswana Institute for Development Policy Analysis (Bidpa).
""We are both in SACU (Southern African Customs Union), that means goods can enter freely, so if we chose those enterprises that South Africa is more competitive at, that puts us at a disadvantage,"" he says.
The key to Botswana's future diversity, many believe, lies in private sector development, and attracting foreign direct investment.
Dr Seleka also believes that due to the country's proximity, combined with its diminutive population, investors tend to set up shop next door.
""If a firm from overseas wants to locate in southern Africa, because of Botswana's market size we are at a disadvantage,"" Dr Seleka says.
""We also need to look at technology readiness, if you look at the types of technologies firms use, and the rate of adoption of new technologies in Botswana it is still not up to scratch.""
One of the solutions to beefing up diversity in the country's economy may lie with its most abundant animal population.
Cattle outnumber the human population by over a million, and beef is the country's third-largest earner.
But despite this, agriculture, in its entirety, only makes up 3% of Botswana's economy.
Bakang Tsheboagae, a cattle farmer from Dutlwe, a village in the Kweneng District of Botswana, says the techniques his family have used for generations to manage their cattle herds have hindered his growth.
Historically our way of tracking cattle are earmarks, which are identical, and you can only brand them once they reach a certain age,"" he says.
""Livestock multiply, and as you multiply it becomes so difficult to count them, or to know which one is where.""
Botswana's cattle and beef industry is driven by exports to Europe, and in order export their beef, farmers must produce traceability records.
""I would say whoever has livestock; small, medium or large scale, ultimately you need a tool that will help you account for whatever you are doing,"" says Mr Tsheboagae.
Enter a new breed of entrepreneur, using technology to modernise the sector.
Thuto Gaotingwe, 26, has developed cattle tracking software Modisar - named after the Tswana word for a herd boy.
Mr Gaotingwe has managed to realise his vision through the help of a one of the government's new entrepreneurial incubators, the Botswana Innovation Hub.
Known as a ""quasi government institution"", the innovation hub is described on its website as part of the state's ""national strategic goal for the diversification of the country's economyâ€¦ set up to support new ventures and existing companies.""
Modisar is a productivity software application that can be installed on a farmer's computer or laptop, and allows the farmer to capture information about his or her farm faster.
Mr Gaotingwe explains: ""We are trying to say, 'look you can make money off livestock farming, only if you do it the right way'.
""So we have built Modisar, and it allows farmers to keep records of his farm assets. Then it allows farmers to know more about livestock diseases.""
Although criticised for being reactive as opposed to proactive, the government has implemented a number of policies, strategies and incentive schemes to encourage diversification.
An Economic Diversifiation Drive (EDD), for example, has been implemented to strengthen the private sector.
The EDD plans to leverage the government's purchasing power, estimated at $2.1bn (Â£1.3bn) per annum, to stimulate local production and consumption by buying from locally based manufacturers and service providers.
Linah Mohohlo also explains that government has also begun exploring diversification options with in mining sector.
""You are now seeing other minerals, such as coal, uranium, copper, nickel coming on-stream,"" says Ms Mohohlo.
Despite facing obstacles, with the right long-term developmental strategies, Botswana has huge potential to diversify.","In Africa, Botswana is often seen as a diamond in the rough.",30546498

"Older People's Commissioner for Wales Sarah Rochira will call on pensioners and their friends and families to hear their experiences of residential care.
The evidence will be used to develop recommendations for care providers and public bodies.
It is part of Ms Rochira's review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales.
She said she would highlight good care but also show the impact of poor care upon older people.
""The voices of older people, as well as those who care for and care about them, are at the heart of my work as commissioner, which is why I want to hear about their experiences of residential care,"" she said.
""I have travelled extensively across Wales, meeting with many older people living in residential care, and have seen for myself the positive impact that high quality care can have on people's lives.
""However, I have also received an increasing amount of correspondence in the past year about the quality of life and care of older people living in residential care and I have spoken publicly about what I consider to be unacceptable variations across Wales.""
The commissioner will be reviewing whether older people living in residential care have a good quality of life by looking at factors such as physical and psychological health, social relationships and the care home environment.
Her team will also speak to care providers, social care staff and public bodies.
""By giving a voice to older people and their families, my review and recommendations will ensure that those who are accountable for and run our services understand the day-to-day realities of living in residential care in Wales and the action required to deliver the change needed to ensure that that older people living in residential care have the best quality of life,"" she said.
The chair of Care Forum Wales, Mario Kreft, said his group was dedicated to developing and promoting best practice in social care and it supported the overall aims of the review.
""Our disappointment however - which will be shared by many providers - is that the commissioner has not included a provider expert on the main advisory panel,"" he said.

"But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.
That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is ""stability"".
This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.
It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.
Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.
The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.
Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.
Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.
He has warned of ""volatility"", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.
""It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,"" said Mr Lightman.
The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?
Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.
But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.
Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.
Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.
This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.
There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.
And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.
But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.
Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.
England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.
When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.
The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.
In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.
This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.
Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.
Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.
Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?
It would take another exam to answer that one.","The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.",34007864
"As Iraq lurches deeper into turmoil and disintegration, Kurdish leaders in the already autonomous north are threatening to break away and declare outright independence.
And the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), bulldozing the border between Iraq and Syria in June 2014, declared their intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay Sykes-Picot to rest forever.
Whatever the fate of IS, the future as unitary states of both Syria and Iraq - central to the Sykes-Picot project - is up in the air.
In fact, virtually none of the Middle East's present-day frontiers were actually delineated in the document concluded on 16 May 1916 by British and French diplomats Mark Sykes and Francois Georges-Picot.
The Iraq-Syria border post histrionically erased by IS was probably several hundred kilometres from the famous ""line in the sand"" drawn by Sykes and Picot, which ran almost directly from the Persian border in the north-east, down between Mosul and Kirkuk and across the desert towards the Mediterranean, veering northwards to loop around the top end of Palestine.
The region's current borders emerged from a long and complex process of treaties, conferences, deals and conflicts that followed the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and the end of World War One.
But the spirit of Sykes-Picot, dominated by the interests and ruthless ambitions of the two main competing colonial powers, prevailed during that process and through the coming decades, to the Suez crisis of 1956 and even beyond.
Because it inaugurated that era, and epitomised the concept of clandestine colonial carve-ups, Sykes-Picot has become the label for the whole era in which outside powers imposed their will, drew borders and installed client local leaderships, playing divide-and-rule with the ""natives"", and beggar-my-neighbour with their colonial rivals.
The resulting order inherited by the Middle East of the day sees a variety of states whose borders were generally drawn with little regard for ethnic, tribal, religious or linguistic considerations.
Often a patchwork of minorities, there is a natural tendency for such countries to fall apart unless held together by the iron grip of a strongman or a powerful central government.
The irony is that the two most potent forces explicitly assailing the Sykes-Picot legacy are at each other's throats: the militants of IS, and the Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria.
In both countries, the Kurds have proven the Western coalition's most effective allies in combating IS, although the two sides share a determination to redraw the map.
""It's not just me that's saying it, the fact is that Sykes-Picot has failed, it's over,"" said the president of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, in a BBC interview.
""There has to be a new formula for the region. I'm very optimistic that within this new formula, the Kurds will achieve their historic demand and right [to independence]"".
""We have passed through bitter experiences since the formation of the Iraqi state after World War One. We tried to preserve the unity of Iraq, but we are not responsible for its fragmentation - it's the others who broke it up.
""We don't want to be part of the chaos and problems which surround Iraq from all sides.""
President Barzani said the drive for independence was very serious, and that preparations were going ahead ""full steam"".
He said the first step should be ""serious negotiations"" with the central government in Baghdad to reach an understanding and a solution, towards what Kurdish leaders are optimistically calling an ""amicable separation"".
If that did not produce results, he said, the Kurds should go ahead unilaterally with a referendum on independence.
""It's a necessary step, because all the previous attempts and experiments failed. If current conditions aren't helpful for independence, there are no circumstances which favour not demanding this right.""
Iraq's Kurds are landlocked and surrounded by neighbours - Syria, Turkey, Iran and Iraq itself - which have traditionally quashed Kurdish aspirations.
Under threat from IS, they are more dependent than ever on Western powers which are also strongly counselling them to stick with Iraq.
But whether or not the Iraqi Kurds achieve full formal independence in the near future, they have already established an entity with borders, a flag, international airports, a parliament and government, and its own security forces - everything except a passport and their own currency.
To that extent, they have already redrawn the map. And next door in northern Syria, their fellow Kurds are essentially doing the same, controlling and running large swathes of land along the Turkish border under the title of ""self-administration"".
As for IS, its territorial gains have already peaked. But the chaos in both Iraq and Syria that allowed it to take root have yet to run their course - the alienation of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority (and the Kurds), and Syria's fragmentation in a vicious sectarian civil war.
The unspoken struggle is over whether formulas can be found for different communities to live together within the borders bequeathed by 20th Century history, or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn to accommodate those peoples - however that concept is defined.
""Sykes-Picot is finished, that's for sure, but everything is now up in the air, and it will be a long time before it becomes clear what the result will be,"" said the veteran Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt.
The Sykes-Picot agreement conflicted directly with pledges of freedom given by the British to the Arabs in exchange for their support against the collapsing Ottomans.
It also collided with the vision of the US President Woodrow Wilson, who preached self-determination for the peoples subjugated by the Ottoman Empire.
His foreign policy adviser Edward House was later informed of the agreement by UK Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour, who 18 months on was to put his name to a declaration which was to have an even more fateful impact on the region.
House wrote: ""It is all bad and I told Balfour so. They are making it a breeding place for future war.""","Reaching its centenary amidst a general chorus of vilification around the region, the legacy of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916 has never looked more under assault.",36300224
"He said it was ""dispiriting if pretty unsurprising"" to see David Cameron's government turn their back on the coalition's ""liberal stance"".
The former deputy prime minister also criticised his former partners' ""swagger"" over the EU referendum.
And, in his final speech to MPs as Lib Dem leader, he predicted the EU debate would ""devour"" Mr Cameron's party.
A contest to replace Mr Clegg is under way after the election left his party with just eight MPs.
""My party's presence may be much, much reduced in size, but our mission is clearer than ever,"" said Mr Clegg.
He said new data monitoring powers, resisted by his party in government, represented a ""turbo charged snooper's charter"", and said there had not been enough to support social care and house-building.

"The Public Accounts Committee says there has been a ""systemic failing"" in support to young people leaving foster care or children's homes.
Its chair Meg Hillier MP says young adults are ""let down by the system that's supposed to support them"".
The government says it is committed to improving the lives of care leavers.
The committee found outcomes for the 10,000 young people aged 16 or over who leave care each year are ""poor and worsening"".
Its report says the quality and cost of support to care leavers ""varies unacceptably"" between local authorities.
Ofsted has rated two-thirds of council care leaver services inadequate or requiring improvement, say the MPs.

These children have often had difficult lives with 62% in care because of abuse or neglect, it adds.
""Those leaving care may struggle to cope with the transition to adulthood and may experience social exclusion, unemployment, health problems, or end up in custody.""

It welcomes government initiatives to improve the lives of care leavers and acknowledges more good practice is emerging but says there is more still to do.
""It's time the government reviewed its care leavers' strategy to make sure these young people get the full support they need,"" said Ms Hillier.
The Department for Education should take formal responsibility for improving the system, the MPs urge.
In particular they believe the DfE should improve care leavers' access to apprenticeships and training, suitable accommodation and better advice.
Town Hall bosses said 40% cuts to their budgets meant providing care leavers with adequate support was ""becoming an increasing challenge"" which councils could not handle alone.
""We urgently need to see the whole system properly funded and joined up to ensure children and young people receive the support they need, when they need it,"" said Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People's Board.
The Department for Education said its reforms would help care leavers make a successful transition to adulthood.
These include giving every care leaver a personal adviser and allowing young people to continue to live with their foster families after 18, though councils complain funding for the latter is ""significantly underestimated"".
A DfE spokesman said the government was also funding apprenticeship programmes for care leavers and encouraging Ofsted to focus more on care leaver support.
""But we want to go further, which is why we've committed to update the cross-government Care Leavers Strategy to improve support for these young people,"" said the spokesman.","Too many of the most vulnerable young people in England are ""cut adrift when they need help the most"", says the head of a powerful committee of MPs.",34667481

"She is in possession of WTA ranking points once again after proving too strong for Roberta Vinci in her first match since a 15-month ban for taking the banned drug meldonium.
There were errors, of course, and her movement is a work in progress, but she served strongly and returned with aggressive intent: hitting nearly twice as many winners as unforced errors. And she played with sheer bloody mindedness, in the way she always has.
The Stuttgart crowd was respectful of Sharapova, and generous in her moment of victory, although the real warmth was reserved for her opponent.
This first win will move the former world number one to the cusp of the top 500, but her ambitions for the week will stretch further, given the way she played and the frailties of some of the top seeds.
Defeats for both Agnieszka Radwanska and Garbine Muguruza mean Sharapova cannot face a seeded player before the semi-finals. The top players in the women's game remain maddeningly inconsistent, and with Serena Williams pregnant, Victoria Azarenka on maternity leave and Petra Kvitova still recuperating from December's stabbing, there are opportunities galore.
Sharapova is a five-time Grand Slam champion, and a likely future champion. This may be her 15th year on tour, but she has missed more time than most due to shoulder problems, as well as the ban. And rest did Roger Federer no harm before the Australian Open in Melbourne, when he clinched his 18th Grand Slam title after a six-month injury lay-off.
She has won Slams on all surfaces and is brimming with motivation on her return from what she considers an unduly harsh ban imposed for an administrative error. And mentally, she is stronger than anyone bar Serena Williams.
But it will probably take time. Stringing together seven wins in a row at a Grand Slam is notoriously difficult when you lack match practice and sharpness, and Sharapova may have to negotiate an extra three matches of qualifying at Roland Garros and Wimbledon.
This was one of the main themes of her first news conference with regular tennis writers for 15 months. I thought she seemed nervous, quite frosty and was confrontational at times.
""I'm not getting a wildcard to receive a trophy or a golden platter,"" she said when asked about the numerous tournament invitations which have upset so many of her peers.
""I have to get through the matches and I still have to win them and that's my job.""
Caroline Wozniacki and Radwanska are just two players to have questioned why a player returning from a doping ban is being offered so many wildcards. The former world number one and number two were dismissed as ""journeyman"" players by Sharapova's agent Max Eisenbud.
""I don't control my manager's words,"" Sharapova said when asked for her response, and then made no attempt to distance herself in the slightest from the sentiments.
""I'm sure he's been watching everyone's comments in the previous 15 months and he's entitled to his own opinion.""
Sharapova's lack of camaraderie has never held her back in the past, and she still has no desire to form friendships on tour. That wouldn't help her tennis, she pointed out. The locker room is where you go for an ice bath, she argued. Her true friends can be found away from the workplace.
Sharapova would love to be at Roland Garros and Wimbledon this year, and she says she would be ""prepared to play in the juniors"" if it helped. She would need to reach the final here in Stuttgart to earn sufficient ranking points to gain direct entry into the qualifying draw of the French Open.
If she fails to do so, her fate will be revealed to great fanfare on the evening of Tuesday 16 May, when wildcards for both qualifying and the main draw will be announced on Facebook Live.
The All England Club is unlikely to go down the same route.
Officially, wildcard recipients will not be determined until Tuesday 20 June, by which time Sharapova could be back in the top 100 and eligible for the main Wimbledon draw. To do so she will need to earn close to 600 ranking points from this week and her next two tournaments in Madrid and Rome.
A return of one semi-final and one quarter-final is likely to be enough, but that would still be some effort after so long away from the sport.","From Maria Sharapova's perspective, Wednesday 26 April could not have gone much better.",39723929

Allardyce added that he plans to discuss transfer targets with owner Ellis Short in the next few days.
Sunderland survived with a game to spare after victory over Everton with Allardyce describing it as a ""miraculous achievement.""
However the former West Ham and Bolton boss, who has never been relegated, says the club must learn from its mistakes this campaign.
""Our season has been a difficult one. I don't want to go through that again - that's the most important thing for me, not to put myself through what I did to get where we are today,"" he added.

""I want to apologise for anything that was said or done,"" said Miss America CEO Sam Haskell.
A tearful Williams called the statement ""unexpected"" and ""beautiful"".
Now 52, she has forged a career as an actress, with major roles in Ugly Betty and Desperate Housewives.
She also scored a global hit in 1992 with the ballad Save the Best for Last; and her recording of Colors of the Wind from Disney's Pocahontas soundtrack earned her a Golden Globe, a Grammy and an Oscar for best original song.
The New Yorker won Miss America in September 1983 but, months later, the pageant's executive committee voted unanimously to request that she resign after Penthouse magazine published naked photographs she had posed for several years earlier,
Williams remains the only title-holder who was asked to resign in the pageant's history.
She was invited back to the competition this year by Chairman Sam Haskell, who asked her to serve as head judge.
Before the competition started, he invited her on stage to receive the apology.
""I have been a close friend to this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years,"" he told the audience. ""You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984 when you resigned.
""Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams.""
He continued: ""I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less than the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.""

"The UNHCR said forced returns had ""continued unabated"" despite an agreement earlier this month.
Under the deal, any returns would be voluntary and only ""when conditions were conducive"".
Cameroon has rejected the accusation and said people returned willingly.
According to the UNHCR, more than 2,600 refugees have been forcibly returned to Nigeria from Cameroon this year.
Many are unable to go back to their villages in Borno state for security reasons and have ended up in camps for displaced people.
In some cases, the UNHCR said, people had been returned ""without allowing them time to collect their belongings"".
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch spoke of ""chaos"" in the returns process and said ""some women were forced to leave their young children behind in Cameroon, including a child less than three years old"".
Many of the returnees are now settled in the Banki camp for internally displaced people.
UNHCR staff also recorded about 17 people who claimed to be Cameroonian nationals, who it said had been deported by mistake to Banki.
It is common in the region to find people who have no documentary proof of their nationality.
Cameroonian Communications Minister Issa Tchiroma told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme: ""I strongly deny this accusation"" of forced returns.
He said the Cameroonian army had been working ""hand-in-hand"" with the Nigerian army against Boko Haram and any civilians who had returned to Nigeria had done so of their own accord.
""This repatriation has taken place willingly,"" he said.
The Cameroonian authorities have previously said Boko Haram militants have been entering the country disguised as refugees.
Militants have carried out a number of attacks in northern Cameroon in recent years, often using suicide bombers.
The UNHCR said forced return constitutes a serious violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1969 OAU Convention, both of which Cameroon has ratified.
It called on Cameroon to honour its obligations under the conventions and continue keeping its borders open so as to allow access to territory and asylum procedures for people fleeing the Islamist insurgency.",The UN refugee agency has criticised Cameroon for the forced return of hundreds of refugees to north-east Nigeria after they had fled from the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency.,39343514
"The city also ranks second in a list of Britain's most congested cities, while Glasgow is third.
Only London ranked worse than Scotland's largest cities in the survey of the UK's roads by Inrix Roadway Analytics.
It found that the jams could cost drivers in Scotland £5.1bn in wasted time over the next decade.
The firm studied traffic hotspots in 21 UK cities in September 2016.
It assessed the impact of the congestion by looking at the average duration of traffic jams, their average length and the number of times they occurred.
The research found that the impact of Edinburgh's 455 traffic hotspots was second only to London and was likely to cost drivers £2.8bn by 2025.
Glasgow was ranked third in the same list - worse than Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol. It's 357 hotspots could cost £2.3bn over the next 10 years, Inrix said.
Researchers calculated the time wasted by drivers in traffic jams across the UK could cost £61.8bn by 2025 if congestion levels are not reduced.
And in their survey of 123 cities across Europe, London was found to have more traffic ""pinch points"" than any other city.

The two heavyweights fight for the IBF title and vacant WBA belt in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley.
Joshua, 27, says his 13 weeks of preparation have been ""tougher times than I have had in any walk of life"".
Klitschko, 41, lost his heavyweight title to Tyson Fury in November 2015 - his first defeat in 11 years.
In an interview at his Sheffield training camp before the biggest fight of his career, Joshua spoke about his motivation, being a ""man of the people"", the state of British boxing, and his family.
Joshua, unbeaten in 18 fights since turning professional in 2013, said he is not worried about his safety in the ring because of the intensity of his training before the fight.
""I've been pushed to places I've never been pushed before,"" said the Briton.
""I think I take more punishment in the gym than I do in the fights. Sometimes I try things and it doesn't work and I've broken my ribs, my hand, dislocated shoulders in the gym but we get it right for the fight.
""One of the main things is his mindset at the minute. He claims he is obsessed and I ask 'What is he obsessed about?' I look at myself in the mirror and it is about beating me.
""I've lived simple. I've been training under the dark light so I can shine under the bright lights on April 29.""
Joshua had numerous incidents with the police as a youth, including being arrested for ABH, drug possession and being electronically tagged. He has previously stated that he would have been in jail were it not for boxing.
But Joshua said: ""I've had tougher times in the gym than I have had in any walk of life at the minute.
""I put myself through it and it is important to because I don't want to be star of the gym and then when I get to the fight it's like: 'I've never faced this type of warrior before.'""
Asked if this is the defining fight of his career, Joshua replied: ""It is one of them. If this was towards the end of my career, I would say: 'This is the defining fight that's going to write the history books.'
""But I've still got so many more years. I'm confident. I'm learning about myself, so this fight is, for me, one fight that I've got to take in my stride round by round and when I take that attitude the victory comes and we move on and there are so many other big fights in the UK.""
Joshua does not believe Klitschko has underestimated him, saying: ""He's coming game, he's coming ready, and the body does what the mind tells it. His mind seems to be in the right place so I'm in for a tough fight.""
""I may not express myself flashing what I've done and telling everyone I'm the greatest,"" he said.
""Where we grew up, everyone was about making money, but low key, understated - you probably didn't want to get your house burgled!
""Who I am when I was 17 is who I am today, so not much has changed.
""You've got to add a bit of flavour. It's needed now and again, but it's got to be real because I don't take boxing as an act. This is way of expressing myself and being true to myself and there are kids watching so you've got to be mindful.
""If I was to be that type of person - loud and trashing tables - after a fight, I would still continue to be that way. What I notice about fighters is they act a certain way and once the fight has started they are hugging each other and are quiet.
""I'm just trying to be myself on camera, in the ring, outside of the ring and off camera.""

Asked about being very accessible, Joshua says: ""It's part of boxing. It is good to lock yourself away but I'm a man of the people, it's no bother. As long as it doesn't make me late for training, I've no problem speaking to 100 people.
""I'm in the same flat that I've been in since 2011 - it's been a long time. I think I'll be one of those guys who will learn the piano, the violin, bungee jump and do all the things I didn't do when I was fighting.
""When I'm not fighting, I try to take a holiday and experience things, but when I'm fighting the simple life has worked and I don't try and change it.""
""I was on the complete opposite end of healthy living before boxing, it's got me strong,"" he said.
""I'm a superhero to my little cousins. It's what it does for my family and my surname Joshua.
""People are proud to wear that name and I'm representing my family. It is nice to have kids supporting you. It's reaching out to a wider audience.
""I'm just a normal person. You have your good days, your bad days, you have road rage, everyone goes through it.
""You've just got to live by the job you do and if that's what comes with it I'd rather choose winning over anything.""
Joshua, who turned professional after winning gold at London 2012, said: ""When I first turned professional, no-one would touch me sponsorship-wise and no-one was really backing boxing.
""I say look at the characters of the sport, look at the individuals, get behind the gloves.""
He praised fellow Brits Tyson Fury, who won the heavyweight title with a win over Klitschko in November 2015, Dillian Whyte, the WBC International heavyweight title holder, former British and Commonwealth heavyweight title holder David Price and Dereck Chisora, who challenged for the WBC heavyweight title in 2012.
""As I've been in the game, Fury won, Dillian, myself, Chisora the likes of Price, up-and-coming heavyweights and lighter weights - it's definitely brought more attention.""
Asked if he was worried about his mum watching his fights, Joshua answers: ""No, no, no, definitely not. Because she's proud, she's happy and I look after her so I think that's the main thing.
""I've got a son and I definitely wouldn't want him to fight because of those reasons, his health, it's tough.
""I did it quietly. When I first started fighting, I didn't tell my family. It was just about me and what I wanted to do.
""My mum has always seen the positive light of fighting rather than the health issues and I've always been on the road to winning and glory.
""She's had a few tough times and a few scares when I've lost as an amateur, but we bounce back, and for all the good times she's forgot about the bad times we've had.""","Anthony Joshua says he will be competing at a ""whole new level"" when he takes on Wladimir Klitschko in Saturday's world title bout.",39709199
"Sandra Bland was arrested during a heated traffic stop captured on film. She was found dead three days later.
The 28-year-old's death and the video footage of her arrest sparked outrage.
The arresting officer, Brian Encinia, has been charged with allegedly lying about it, a prosecutor announced after a day of grand jury discussions.
Hours later, he was fired from his job.
The grand jury had picked out the officer's affidavit as behind their decision, said special prosecutor Shawn McDonald.
In that affidavit, Mr Encinia had claimed that Ms Bland was ""combative and uncooperative"" after he pulled her over.
The argument began after she was asked to put out her cigarette and he demanded she get out of her car.
Video footage showed the police officer drawing his stun gun and threatening Ms Bland with the words: ""I will light you up!""
After the argument moved off-camera, she was heard screaming that he was about to break her wrists and she complained that her head knocked against the ground.
Mr McDonald said grand jurors found Mr Encinia's statement that he had ""removed her from her vehicle to further conduct a safer traffic investigation"" to be false.
Soon after the indictment, the Texas Department of Public Safety said ""termination proceedings"" would start immediately.
Ms Bland's death three days after her arrest was ruled a suicide and the sheriff's officials and jailers were cleared of any crime.

"Aodhan Woods was just 17 when he was tied up, locked in a cupboard and subjected to several sexual assaults.
Now 19, he has waived his right to anonymity as his attackers were jailed.

The unnamed abuser was 17 at the time of the offence and a reporting restriction is in place which prevents his identity from being made public.
The attack took place on 30 May, 2014 when Mr Woods called to Fu's flat in the Stranmillis area of Belfast.
A previous hearing in the case was told Fu had ordered him to sell drugs and he was worried before entering the flat because he had not sold enough.
The attack began almost immediately and the court heard the pair subjected him to ""exceptional degradation"", holding him at knifepoint, burning him with cigarettes, and seriously sexually assaulting him.
The ordeal lasted a number of hours before they released the teenager, who then contacted police.
Speaking outside court, Mr Woods said: ""I thought I was going to die that night. I will never forget what happened.""
He described it as the ""worst experience of his life"".
""I didn't know what was going to happen and what they were going to do.  The whole ordeal was just terrifying.""

Mr Woods thanked his family and friends and the police for supporting him through the criminal justice process.
""I would say to anyone else who has been sexually assaulted, don't be afraid, don't hide it. The only way to move forward is to tell someone and you'll soon realise there is so much support. Don't be afraid to speak out.""

The proposed cycle route will link Leith Walk in the east of the city to Roseburn in the west, via the city centre and Haymarket.
The plans include reducing four lanes of traffic from Roseburn to Haymarket to two, and using half a carriageway and a bus lane for cyclists.
Supporters of the path said it was vital for cutting congestion and would provide a safe route across the city. They said it would also encourage more active travel.
But residents and shop owners in the Roseburn area said reducing loading bays to make way for bikes would have a huge impact on passing trade, and that reducing traffic lanes could increase congestion at Roseburn.

"Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer of heavy construction equipment.
The firm has operations in Larne, Newtownabbey and west Belfast.
Caterpillar's Northern Ireland business employs 1,800 people and mainly makes diesel generators.
The firm has been hit by a global downturn in mining and oil exploration which has reduced demand for its products.
It is understood that the company may announce cuts across its global operations beyond Northern Ireland.
It has already axed thousands of jobs worldwide since last year as part of a major restructuring programme.
Since 2011 it has shed more than 1,000 posts in Northern Ireland and moved some work to factories in China.
It is understood night-shifts have been cancelled, with staff told to expect official news on Thursday.
Caterpillar refused to comment on any jobs announcement yesterday.
But a spokesman added:  ""Caterpillar is committed to communicating regularly and directly with our employees about the business environment and any resulting changes"".
Sinn FÃ©in MP for West Belfast Paul Maskey said yesterday: ""Uncertainty over the future of Caterpillar's operations in the north will be no doubt distressing for workers and their families.""

"The detentions come less than a week before a visit to Cuba by Pope Francis.
Most of the activists were members of the predominantly Catholic dissident group, Ladies in White.
They walked through the streets of Havana holding up pictures of political prisoners, before they were rounded up by police.
According to Cuba's main dissident website, 14yMedio, members of Ladies in White and activists from other opposition groups were handcuffed and pushed into police cars and buses on Sunday afternoon.
A number of them were released hours later, it said.
Cuba says the protesters are financed by right-wing American groups to destabilise the government.
Cuban dissidents are planning to protest during the Pope's visit to the island, which begins on Saturday.
They have accused the Cuban Catholic Church of becoming too cosy with the government of Raul Castro and failing to speak out against human rights abuses.
""The Church should be concerned about this or any time human rights are involved. It's their duty,"" said Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of leading dissident group Patriotic Union of Cuba.
He told the Reuters news agency he was handcuffed and taken to a police station after Sunday's protest.
Police later dropped him off at a bus terminal, he said.
The Cuban Catholic Church says it defends the respect of human rights but cannot take up individual political causes.
Pope Francis played a key role in facilitating the historic negotiations between Cuba and the United States, which led to diplomatic relations being restored after more than five decades of hostilities.

There had been fears that the new owners would not take on the existing workers' pension scheme.

Unite said it understood that the Bernard Matthews final salary pension scheme was closed in 2004 and that its members presently have an alternative pension scheme which is unaffected the takeover.
The Boparan Private Office, the ""chicken king"" Mr Boparan's private investment, confirmed that the current pension arrangements with Bernard Matthews would continue under the new ownership.

"The Spaniard, 27, spent three years at Barca and joins the Blues after Arsenal turned down a first option to buy him.
Fabregas joins for an undisclosed fee and said Chelsea matched his football ambitions, adding he had ""unfinished business"" in the Premier League.
""I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice,"" he said.
While the fee for the move is unknown, the Spanish club were happy for Fabregas to leave for a fee in the region of £30m.
His arrival comes 10 days after England midfielder Frank Lampard announced he would end his 13-year stay at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is also keen to finalise the transfer of Spanish international Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid, as he bids to improve on his side's third-place finish in 2013-14.
""Twelve months ago, Fabregas was not prepared to let his Barcelona dream die by joining Manchester United. Now he has decided the time is right for a return to the Premier League.
""At Chelsea he will be filling the role of Frank Lampard, who signed off this summer after  13 glorious years when he won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and became the club's highest scorer.
""That is the legacy Fabregas will be expected to live up to. Jose Mourinho will demand it.""
""They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager,"" added Fabregas, who has 89 caps for Spain. ""I am fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start playing.""
Fabregas, who scored 50 times in 305 games for Arsenal during his previous spell in England, will wear the number-four shirt and join Ramires, Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel as central midfield options for Mourinho.
He scored 35 goals in 129 appearances for Barcelona, but it failed to earn him a regular midfield role at the Nou Camp, with the trio of Xavi Hernandez, Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets viewed as the club's main central combination.
Still Arsenal's youngest ever player at just 16 years and 177 days, Fabregas was expected to have been subject of a bid from his former club.
But with Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil, Mikel Arteta and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all able to fulfil central roles, Gunners manager Arsene Wenger chose not to sign the man he made captain in 2008.
""Yes, everyone knows that Arsenal had the first option to sign me,"" added Fabregas, who said it was ""extremely important"" the move was completed before the World Cup finals.

"""I have to work with Ikea - make furniture for interior design, for architecture,"" he told BBC Radio 1.
He said students would be particularly keen for him to create ""a minimalist apartment inside of a college dorm"".
""Yo Ikea, allow Kanye to create, allow him to make this thing because you know what, I want a bed that he makes, I want a chair that he makes.""
West was pictured visiting Ikea's head office in Almhult, south Sweden, earlier this year. He has previously collaborated with British fashion designer Katie Eary who has, in turn, created a series of textiles and tableware for Ikea.
The company has so far declined to comment on a possible tie-in with West, who has a sideline designing clothes and shoes.
Its ethos of providing affordable goods would chime with West's ambition to make his own products more affordable.
The star's interview with Annie Mac also covered his headline set at the 2015 Glastonbury festival.
He said a musical error at the beginning made him forget his lyrics, with knock-on effects for the rest of the set.
""It was incredible. I started off the show and I completely messed up the music. And me, as you can imagine by this phone call, I'm a bit of a perfectionist. So it really put me into a slightly depressed state and it put me back in the position of when I was in high school and I got fired from my job.
""I don't usually get nervous, I prepare, I get fully prepared. When that music messed up in the beginning it tapped into my nerves and when you're nervous or vulnerable something special and something different can happen.""
And he discussed his political ambitions, after previously declaring he would run for president in 2020.
""When I talk about the idea of being president, I'm not saying I have any political views,"" said the 39-year-old. ""I just have a view on humanity, on people, on the truth.
""We are numb, we're numb to 500 kids getting killed in Chicago a year, we're numb to the fact that it was seven police shootings in the beginning of July.

"Seven organisations have issued joint advice on vitamin D, which the body gets from natural sunlight.
The nutrient keeps bones strong, and protects against conditions like osteoporosis.
The guidance was drawn up because it is thought fears about skin cancer have made people too cautious about being in the sun.
Cancer Research UK and the National Osteoporosis Society are among the bodies which agree that ""little and frequent"" spells in summer sunshine several times a week can benefit your health.
The experts now say it is fine to go outside in strong sun in the middle of the day, as long as you cover up or apply sunscreen before your skin goes red.
Professor Rona Mackie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: ""Total sun protection with high factor suncream on all the time is not ideal, in terms of vitamin D levels.
""Even Australia has changed its policy on this. They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year.
""Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense.
""What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.""
Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five.
But the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP.
Winter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine.
Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: ""A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk.
""The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex.
""There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer.
""But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer.
""We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.""
The joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research.
These include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.",New health advice recommends short spells in the sun - without suncream and in the middle of the day.,12013332
"The organisations used the Freedom of Information Act to get details on pay packages for everyone from managers and hospital doctors to dentists and GPs.
Researchers included bonuses, pension contributions and redundancy payments, as well as salaries, in the sums.
The Taxpayers' Alliance said some of the figures were concerning.
In particular, the lobby group highlighted the sums being paid to senior managers.
The overwhelming majority of staff on six-figure salaries were clinical, including GPs, hospital consultants and dentists.
But nearly 2,400 of the staff were employed by NHS bodies in the UK in non-clinical roles - of these 472 earned more than £150,000.
The Daily Mail said its analysis of annual accounts of NHS bodies showed that the pay bill for NHS directors had risen by 22% in two years.
Another 534 employees of quangos were also on six-figure salaries.
Taxpayers' Alliance chief executive Jonathan Isaby said: ""No-one begrudges paying doctors and nurses well for the tough jobs they do, but it's galling to see bosses at failing hospitals continuing to rake in the cash.
""It's an insult to taxpayers, but it's even worse for patients who have suffered because of mismanagement and worse.
""The rewards-for-failure culture is rife in the NHS and it must be stamped out as a matter of urgency.""
However, separate figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre have shown that overall the number of managers in the health service in England, including senior and lower level ones, has been falling.
There are now just over 37,600 employed - down by nearly a fifth in five years.
Ministers in England also pointed out that they had written to NHS bodies to discourage ""retire and rehire"" practices where staff get lucrative pay-offs and then start working again in closely linked jobs, while any salaries above the level of the prime minister's now needed to be scrutinised by the Department of Health.
Health Minister David Prior said: ""We are absolutely clear that value for money for the taxpayer is vital, every pound that is wasted or spent unnecessarily is a pound that cannot be spent on looking after patients.""
Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, defended the pay levels, saying being a chief executive in the NHS ""was one of the toughest jobs in the country"".
And he added: ""In the toughest environment for the NHS in a generation, we need good leaders who can transform care. They need the ambition and the skills to take people with them, and have the stability and time to build relationships around a common shared goal for their local population.""","More than 50,000 people in the NHS earned more than £100,000 in 2013-14, an investigation by the Taxpayers' Alliance and Daily Mail shows.",34775982

"The $43bn (£33bn) deal is set to be the biggest ever foreign takeover by a Chinese company.
The deal was cleared by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which checks deals for national security implications.
About a quarter of  Syngenta's sales are in North America.
China National Chemical Corporation offered $465 per share for Syngenta in February. Syngenta's shares subsequently fell to about 20% below that because of concerns that CFIUS would not clear the deal.
However, now competition authorities elsewhere are expected to give the deal the go-ahead.
In a joint statement, Syngenta and ChemChina said: ""In addition to CFIUS clearance, the closing of the transaction is subject to anti-trust review by numerous regulators around the world and other customary closing conditions.
""Both companies are working closely with the regulatory agencies involved and discussions remain constructive. The proposed transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.""

The Russian ex-Arsenal forward is still playing for Kairat at the age of 34, but when his career ends he can still fall back on the fashion design skills he learned at university, where his thesis was on tracksuit design. Turns out he's pretty handy with a needle and thread, too.
Tottenham and Manchester United fans used to say he was an artist when he played in the Premier League. Now playing for PAOK in Greece, the Bulgarian striker is as deft with a pencil in his hand as he is with the ball at his feet. He has posted sketches of rapper Snoop Dogg, actor Marlon Brando and the Breaking Bad cast to his social media accounts.
The Everton full-back, 35, has not made a first-team appearance this season, which will have given him more time to focus on his carp fishing empire.

"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks.
""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,"" Mr Haldane said.
""This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.""
Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US.
Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year.
Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as ""writhing in both agony and ecstasy"".
He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said.
However, he said the ""reasons to be fearful"" included productivity and wages, which had not risen.
""If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,"" said Mr Haldane.
Sterling dropped 0.5% against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile.
Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was ""more unstable than it has been for some time"".
Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were ""a lot of global risks out there at the moment"" affecting the international economy.
""Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,"" Mr Osborne said.
He added: ""I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border.
""The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.""
He said it was important to ""make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters"".
Earlier this month, Mr Osborne warned that the eurozone slowdown will impact UK economy.","Interest rates should remain low to avoid long-term economic stagnation, the chief economist at the Bank of England has said.",29656342

Australia, seeking a fourth successive World T20 title, chose to bat and posted 148-5, with Elyse Villani making the first half century in a final.
But 18-year-old Windies opener Hayley Matthews hit a stunning 66 off 45 balls with three sixes, in a stand of 120.
The Windies won with three balls to spare and their men's team later completed a T20 double.
West Indies had lost all of their eight previous T20 internationals against Australia and in their first final they made a nervous start bowling at the iconic Eden Gardens.
Villani (52) seized on some wayward full tosses to reach her fifty from 34 balls.
Australia skipper Meg Lanning hit three successive fours in her 52 and the elegant Ellyse Perry dispatched two glorious straight drives for six in a cameo 28.
Having fought back by conceding only a single from the final over they bowled, the Windies made a slow start to their reply, scoring three from the first two overs.

But Matthews and skipper Stafanie Taylor hit 16 from the fifth over, bowled by Perry, and recorded their century partnership in the 14th over.
Matthews was caught with 29 more runs required from 26 balls and Taylor's 59 ended with only five left to score from eight deliveries.
Three were needed from the final over and victory was secured after a routine run-out opportunity turned into an overthrow, to spark exuberant West Indian celebrations, joined by the men's team who were arriving for their final with England.
It continued a welcome resurgence for West Indian cricket, after the Under-19 team beat India to win the 50-over World Cup in February.
West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor:
""I've been waiting for this a long time and it has come at the right time.
""We didn't get the start we wanted but the batting has done it for us.
""It was fantastic to know that the men were with us. [Men's captain Darren] Sammy sent me a text this morning 'Staf you are going to do it, you girls you are going to do it'.""

Australia skipper Meg Lanning:
""Full credit to the West Indies, they came out with the bat, and we did not quite get the result we wanted.
""We felt we were a little short, 160 would have been nice, but if we bowled well we would have defended.
""It was a really exciting, tough road into the World Cup and I am proud of the effort that everyone has put in.""
Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special:
""The Windies have brought power into this tournament.
""Hayley Matthews running down the wicket and hitting Ellyse Perry for six was probably the moment of the tournament.
""They have discipline in their game now. If this team can tighten up with the bowling and handle pressure they will be a dangerous force going forward.""",West Indies claimed their first Women's World Twenty20 with a pulsating eight-wicket win over Australia in Kolkata.,35954233
"""None of the computers or machines worked except for the General Electric-powered machines like the MRIs [magnetic resonance imaging],"" recalled Mykhailo Radutskyi, president of the Boris Clinic - Kiev's largest medical clinic.
His radiologists decided to turn off the body scanners anyway as a precautionary measure after the building's IT system went down at two o'clock in the morning in late June.
Doctors across the centre had to resort to taking records solely by paper and pen for the first time since the mid-1990s.
""The main problem for us was that Ukrainian law requires us to keep all our patient info for 25 years, and we lost that medical documentation for the 24 hours when our systems were down,"" Mr Radutskyi divulged.
""But thankfully we keep back-ups, so we didn't lose any information.""
All in all, Mr Radutskyi reckons his clinic's damage tally totalled $60,000 (Â£46,000).
Others have been unwilling to reveal how badly they were hit. Oschadbank - one of the country's biggest lenders - was among those that declined an interview with the BBC.
Even now, almost a month after the so-called NotPetya strike, some companies inside and outside the nation are still facing disruption.
Ukraine's top cyber-cop disclosed that some of the nation's largest companies were still too scared to share the full scale of the fallout with his investigators.
And Sergiy Demedyuk - head of Ukraine's ministry of internal affairs' cybercrime division - added he has come to believe there are aftershocks still to come since the hackers appear to have compromised their targets for some time before they pounced, and might still be sitting on data they could yet exploit.
NotPetya initially appeared to be a ransomware attack, but many now suspect its blackmail demands were a cover for something more ominous.
Experts who have spoken to the BBC are seemingly sure of two things: first, Ukraine was the target, and second, it was not about money.
Despite denials, suspicion has fallen on Ukraine's eastern neighbour, Russia.
""Cyber-attacks are just one part of Russia's wider efforts to destabilise the country,"" Nato's former chief civil servant Anders Fogh Rasmussen told the BBC.
""In my time as secretary general we agreed that a cyber-attack could trigger Nato's mutual defence clause.
""The Alliance has been assisting Ukraine especially with monitoring and investigating security incidents. However... more support is also needed for prevention.""
One cybersecurity veteran has been investigating how a local software developer's program, MeDoc, came to be hijacked to spread the malware.
""It wasn't just [a case of] take over MeDoc's update server and push out NotPetya,"" explained Nicholas Weaver from University of California, Berkeley.
""Instead, they had previously compromised MeDoc, made it into a remote-control Trojan, and then they were willing to burn this asset to launch this attack,"" he added, referring to the fact the servers have since been confiscated by the police.
""That really is huge.""
MeDoc's tax filing services were used by more than 400,000 customers across Ukraine, representing about 90% of its domestic firms.
Although it was not mandatory for local companies to use it, by virtue of its ubiquity, it's almost as if it were.
""This was gold they had, basically a control point in almost every business that does business in Ukraine,"" said Mr Weaver.
""And they burned this resource in order to launch this destructive attack.""
Mr Demedyuk said his police force had concrete evidence that MeDoc was hacked a long time ago and had been used to spy on economic activity within Ukraine.
""The [developers] claimed on their website that it was certificated, that it had been examined with international audit and it's 100% safe. In fact, it wasn't true,"" he added.
One ex-US Army cyber-expert said the hackers might have felt forced to carry out their attack through fear that MeDoc's computer servers were about to slip out of their control.
""If you read [security firm] ESET's report, you see that they gained and lost access repeatedly as legitimate MeDocs updates were pushed,"" Jon Nichols said.
""It is possible that the actors just wanted to cause as much damage as they could before they lost control again.""
This theory is backed up by another US expert.
""It's not unheard of if you think you'll lose your position to launch prematurely,"" said Beau Woods deputy director of the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative.
He added that if the perpetrators had, indeed, gathered financial data about most of Ukraine's companies, they might still find ways to cause further damage.
Mr Demedyuk said that although only four police officers had been assigned to his NotPetya investigation full-time, he had about 300 people across Ukraine supporting the inquiry.
Furthermore, he has met with Interpol to discuss ways to share information with other international authorities.
While they try to unravel how the attack was carried out, others are preparing for follow-up cyber-assaults.
In particular, the chief executive of Ukraine's state-owned energy giant Ukrenergo is concerned it will be a target.
""All our life as an independent country in the last 25 years, we've been connected to the Russian power grid and they've balanced us,"" Vsevolod Kovalchuk told the BBC.
However, he explained, an agreement his firm has struck with European electricity transmission operators to modernise Ukraine's power grid might have put the firm in Moscow's cross-hairs.
It might sound like paranoia, but Ukrenergo had already been hit by two cyber-attacks prior to NotPetya.
One occurred just before Christmas.
""That virus worked in our local network for over one year,"" Mr Kovalchuk said.
""It collected information and after collecting the information, the hackers put another malware specific for our northern substation and switched it off for 15 minutes. It was only a test but they tried and it was successful.""
Before that Ukrenergo was caught up in the infamous Black Energy attack, in December 2015. It took down half a city's power for three hours in the dead of winter.
The two incidents meant the firm was already battle-hardened when it was infected by NotPetya.
""A dispatcher called me and said they couldn't do anything because all of their screens had turned black and were asking for money,"" recalled Mr Kovalchuk.
""That was at 11:02 EET [Eastern European Time], and then several minutes later, other computers were in the same situation so I called to my chief IT officer and asked what is this, is this WannaCry or something similar?"" he said referring to a ransomware attack that disrupted the NHS and others in May.
""We disconnected our networks, switched off our computers, and then we used our protocols from the past, using paper standards, phones and continued to operate without any computers, without databases, without any systems.""
This time round, the electricity grid was unharmed and power flowed uninterrupted. But the company was left without secondary functions for 10 days.
For Ukraine, the most important questions from here on seem to be: How bad does an attack have to be before serious international attention is paid to it? And: At what point does it become a war crime?
""I think that every six months, we'll see attacks,"" predicted Prof Michael Schmitt, lead author of the Tallinn Manual - the definitive international legal guide to cyber-conflict.
""Even though I'm not 100% sure that it's Russia, I don't understand which other country could attack Ukraine. It's the only logical answer.""
And Ukrainian cybersecurity experts like Alexey Yankovski believe every single business is at risk.
""Ukraine is a playground for attacks, and a large part of the cyber-security community here believes that most of the companies have already been infected,"" he told the BBC.
""Every company here should be prepared for the fact that it will be hacked sooner or later.""
This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security. The coverage is timed to coincide with the two biggest shows in the security calendar - Black Hat and Def Con.

"Twenty-five suspects were released because of a lack of evidence.
It is the latest batch of death sentences passed in connection with the killings - 36 men were hanged a year ago for their part in the massacre.
IS filmed the killings, at the former US base of Camp Speicher, near Tikrit, in an early piece of shock propaganda.
Most of the victims are believed to have been young Shia recruits who were based at the camp when Tikrit was overrun by IS.
Photos and videos published by IS at the time showed soldiers being lined up and shot at various locations.
Some bodies were pushed into the River Tigris, while others were buried in mass graves that were found after government forces recaptured the city a year later.

"Lionel Portillo-Meza pleaded not guilty in the death of Brian Terry in an Arizona court on Wednesday.
Weapons found at the scene of his death were linked to a US anti-gun-running scheme called Fast and Furious.
Under the programme, the US allowed criminals to purchase guns in order to trace them to major arms traffickers.
But US agents lost track of 1,400 of the firearms, including the ones believed to have killed Terry.
A US justice department report has cited 14 people for possible disciplinary action for their roles in the programme.
Mr Portillo-Meza was arrested in Mexico in 2012.  He was flown to the US on Tuesday.
He has been charged with murder, as well as assault and other charges.
""This development brings us one step closer to achieving justice for a beloved agent who paid the highest price in protecting this country,"" said US Attorney for Southern California Laura Duffy.
""While there is nothing that can be done to bring Agent Terry home again, we hope this news will bring some level of comfort.""
Another man, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, was sentenced to 30 years in prison in February for the 2010 murder, which occurred as Osorio-Arellanes and his gang engaged in a firefight with US border agents in rural Arizona.
The US justice department announced a $1m (Â£589,000) reward in 2012 for information leading to the arrest of Mr Portillo-Meza, and three others.
Two of the men remain fugitives, while the third is waiting in Mexican custody for extradition.
Robert Heyer, Terry's cousin and the family's spokesman, said they were ""thankful that Mexican authorities have continued to work with us"".

During his trial at the Old Bailey, the jury was told he forced a 14-year-old girl to perform a sex act on him after getting her drunk.

Det Supt Gary Ridgway from Cambridgeshire Police said the sentence showed ""just how serious this type of offence is"".
""This represents justice for young people who had the courage to stand up in court and relive some very difficult experiences,"" he said.
Khubaib was the tenth person to be convicted under Operation Erle, which focussed on allegations of sex abuse by other groups of men and boys against young girls.

"For just over a year when I was 14 years old, I suffered from anorexia nervosa. Weighing a tiny amount, I bought children's clothing and consumed fewer than 500 calories a day.
Anorexia nervosa is far from just a battle of wills to resist eating a chocolate bar. It's a serious mental illness. A possession. As though developing a split personality -yourself and the anorexia. In fact, that's exactly what happened to me.
Prior to the illness, I'd been a happy girl and enjoyed a great relationship with my parents, but that deteriorated when anorexia embedded itself in my head. I developed techniques and deceptive ways to make it look like I'd eaten when I hadn't.
I'd dispose of food in literally any way I could. I became sneaky and desperate, and I'd lie constantly, dreading any time away from school because home-time meant food time.
'I've eaten' techniques included sprinkling toaster crumbs on a plate to make it look like I'd had toast. I'd hide any food down sleeves, in pockets, in bras, in my cheeks, anything to avoid swallowing it. I'd mop up milk from my cereal with tissues.
For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation.
For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. And I knew how much EVERYTHING provided me with.
My mum was immediately on my tail when I started to get thin. I'd exercise compulsively — literally anything to burn calories. I'd relish any chance to get away from my parents so that I could burn calories exercising. I remember running laps of the playground during Girl Guide hours in the evening because it was the only time I could run and burn calories. My patrol must have thought I was very strange.
Now that I was below a healthy weight, my periods had stopped and I was attending weekly appointments at the Youth Hospital seeing a dietician and a psychologist. I was clinically depressed and spent every day being force-fed by my parents while I screamed and cried like a banshee at the threat of being fed two spoonfuls of ice cream.
I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself.
The body dysmorphia was terrible. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. I believe that I still suffer from this dysmorphia a little even now, over ten years later and at a much healthier weight.
My recovery was largely down to my mum, whose persistence in monitoring my every move eventually forced the voice in my head to say 'I can't win this', and slowly begin to shrink back. I remember that moment vividly as though the anorexia actually admitted defeat and resigned.
To this day, I can see a girl in the gym and know that she's struggling. I think it's in the arms. There's one at my gym right now. I see her working her tiny limbs like a demon on the spin bike, only she barely has any real muscle to power herself.
The fight to create a more versatile fashion and beauty industry is still one which is continuing relentlessly today. ALL healthy bodies are beautiful in any shape, any size and any form.
It's not about banishing sample sizes from the runways, TV and magazines, it's about creating body diversity. Young girls need to see models walk down the catwalk with healthy bodies resembling that of the average woman. They shouldn't have to be labelled as 'plus size', because they're not. They're just women.

But some now hound their enemies online. The underlying rage is reminiscent. The instinct for intimidation is the same. Despite all its strengths and all its engagement with the world, China is once again prey to political groupthink and fear.
The latest trigger is a speech by a Chinese student at an American campus. On 21 May, at an official event, Shuping Yang praised the fresh air and freedom of speech she had found at the University of Maryland.
The video clip of her speech quickly went viral and triggered an outpouring of anger from fellow Chinese students in the US and critics at home. Shuping Yang swiftly apologised, asked forgiveness and said she had no intention to belittle her country. But that was not enough to stop the flood of ""I am proud of China"" posts accusing her of lies and deception, or the online ""human flesh searches"" to dig up incriminating information about her and her family.
Of course there are good reasons to be proud of China and every Chinese citizen is entitled to list them. In the past week alone, China has sent a submersible deep into the Mariana Trench and its world champion go player Ke Jie took on the AlphaGo AI computer programme and almost beat it. Every day ordinary Chinese people display the energy, talent and hard work of which their fellow citizens should be proud.
But being proud of China does not mean denying another Chinese citizen the right to an opinion. In fact, Shuping Yang herself said she too was proud in her message of apology.
The irony is that the very backlash against her has only served to make her point about the want of freedom of speech in her homeland. It has also highlighted a conflict between a commitment to free speech in Western countries that host large communities of Chinese students and the growing determination of the Chinese government and some of its citizens that free speech should be limited when it comes to talking about China, even beyond Chinese borders.
Freedom of speech is any society's feedback loop. It means precisely the freedom to say what is different or what may even offend. Of course, different societies have a different view on how much of this is appropriate. But if China's freedom of speech goes no further than parroting the leader and attacking those who dare to speak from a different script, then its spirit is lurking in the shadow of the Mao era.
Which brings us to Chairman Xi and his style of leadership. In English Xi Jinping is usually referred to as President Xi. But his power comes from being leader of the Communist Party and since taking up that role five years ago, he has collapsed the distinction between party and government and dramatically shrunk the space for freedom of speech.
All public debate, whether in the media, academia, the legal profession or online, is a shadow of what it was in 2012. It is now off-limits to discuss universal values or liberal democracy.  Instead China must loudly unite around the leadership of the Communist Party and ""tell China's story confidently"".
Confidence is understandable. In Xi Jinping's first five-year term, China has become the world's second-largest economy and an increasingly powerful military power. But when Chairman Xi urges journalists, think-tanks and diplomats to ""tell China's story confidently"" he does not mean tell it how you like and with your own nuance. Students abroad are a particularly important voice in this chorus. It is stated Chinese government policy to ""assemble the broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy"".
And so when the University of California San Diego announced that it would host a speech by Tibet's spiritual leader the Dalai Lama next month, the local Chinese Students and Scholars Association consulted with diplomats and threatened ""tough measures to resolutely resist the school's unreasonable behaviour"". At Durham University in the UK, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, again with the support of the Chinese embassy, attempted to bar from a debate a critic of China's religious policies and human rights record.
This week's mobilisation against Shuping Yang, complete with commentaries in leading state media, is part of this drive for ""positive patriotic energy"".
All of which causes some bafflement on the campuses concerned. Students from countries with a tradition of free speech may feel irritation with someone who criticises their homeland in a public speech, but their instinct is usually to shrug it off or make a joke. Likewise when Chinese state media deploy students from Western countries praising China and its policies, such individuals do not become hate figures for outraged student associations or national newspapers.
That's because liberal societies take differences of opinion for granted. In the US, in Europe and in Australia, citizens regularly excoriate their own governments and praise other countries in the media, and on satirical TV and radio shows. They also mount protests against their leaders.
It is vital to Beijing that these habits should not rub off. So in Chairman Xi's era the numbers of Chinese students studying abroad is going up but their tolerance of diverging views on China is going down.
In one respect, this is puzzling. At great expense, young Chinese have chosen to move from the confines of China's tightly-controlled education system to the ""fresh air"" of campuses which cherish tolerance and which offer all the tools to explore a range of different narratives of their own place in the world through reading and debate. But it is not so puzzling if you factor in these students' prior ideological education, the pressure on them to perform academically, and the ever-present and watchful eye of the Chinese state.
Tension is likely to grow between the liberal values of Western campuses and the ""positive patriotic energy"" of the growing numbers of Chinese students on these campuses. But the very strength of the reaction to Shuping Yang's freedom speech ensures that her words will continue to echo.
After all, it's not just Western culture which honours a loyal opposition. It is firmly entrenched in the historical memory of China too. Respect resonates down through the centuries for officials and soldiers in the imperial and the more recent Communist era who braved banishment or death for daring to speak truth to power.
So be #proudofChina by all means, but don't go back to the frenzy of the Red Guard era, and remember that in all great civilisations, the patriots whose memories endure are often those who love their country enough to point out its flaws.","Half a century ago millions of Chairman Mao's Red Guards gathered in rallies in Tiananmen Square to chant slogans and wave their red books of his quotations in a show of loyalty to the ideas of the ""Great Helmsman"".",39996940
"The inquiry will look at historical abuse of children in care in Scotland.
But John Findlay, who was abused while a pupil in the care of Aberlour House in Moray, said money would be better spent supporting victims.
He said the inquiry was ""yet another process"" rather than progress towards helping people.
Mr Findlay told BBC Scotland's Timeline programme how he had spoken publically before about what happened to him, but has not been contacted about giving evidence to the inquiry.
He was abused by one of his teachers, who is no longer alive, at Aberlour House, a prep school for Gordonstoun private school in Moray which Mr Findlay went on to attend.
Mr Findlay was assaulted in his bed in a dormitory after being given what he described as a form of date rape drug.
""He fondled my genitalia. He put his head under the covers, He took photographs,"" said Mr Findlay of the attack.
""Once I was able to move afterwards I confronted him about it. I was convinced by him that I imagined it, that nothing happened.""
Mr Findlay said what happened to him as a child ""tainted"" his adult life, including work and personal relationships.
On the inquiry, he said: ""I would love to say I have hope, however, it is yet another announcement of yet another inquiry and yet another process.
""I see actually no progression whatsoever with regards to any government or any school providing genuine help for victims of abuse.
""It is all very well saying 'yeah, we are looking into it', but for crying out loud it is about time you could just turn around and say instead of spending how ever much on inquiries why not just spend the money on helping the victims of this abuse.""
Gordonstoun is among boarding schools and other institutions involved in the investigation.
In a statement. Gordonstoun said: ""We welcome the Scottish Abuse Inquiry's invitation to submit a report and will respond in full.
""Cases of non-recent abuse must be unimaginably distressing for the victims and their families and the work that the Scottish Abuse Inquiry is undertaking will, we hope, draw important lessons from the past and make children safer in the future.
""For everyone at Gordonstoun today, making sure our students are happy, healthy and safe is at the heart of everything we do.
""We are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all our students. Our ongoing work in this area was recognised in our most recent independent Care Inspectorate Report which gave us a rating of five -  'very good' - for pupil care and support and noted the 'comprehensive child protection procedures' in place.""
The Scottish government said it had established one of the widest ranging public inquiries that Scotland has ever seen into the abuse of children in care.
A spokesperson said: ""It will focus on the systemic institutional failures which saw many of our most vulnerable children, including those in the care of the state, abused by the very individuals who were there to care for them.
""We want that inquiry to be able to undertake its work in a timescale that can address the issues raised by survivors.
""Scotland is one of the few countries in the world that has dedicated funding for support services for adult survivors of child abuse.
""We have made real progress in delivering what survivors told us they wanted, including a greatly expanded support fund of Â£13.5m over five years to co-ordinate access to and deliver resources, integrated care and support for those who were abused in care.""
The spokesperson said Deputy First Minister John Swinney had also committed to a consultation on redress, pledging to work with survivors to consider the wide range of differing views on the subject.
The spokesperson added: ""Last year, we introduced legislation to make it easier to take civil action against historic child abuse, and we also reviewing the child protection system to ensure it is as effective as it can be.""","A victim of child abuse has criticised the decision to hold an inquiry to investigate more than 60 institutions, including several top private schools.",38839537
"Lilliard Gin is based at the Born in the Borders visitor centre in Jedburgh.
It comes ahead of a number proposals, which are at various stages of the planning process, to open the region's first whisky distillery since 1837.
Lead distiller Kate Macinnes said the potential to make the Scottish Borders a ""region of distilling excellence"" was ""really exciting"".
""Our gin production is on a completely different scale to the other distilleries in development,"" she said.
""Our still is one of the smallest production stills in the UK, and our entire operation fits into a cowshed, but if people like our gin, that's all that matters.
""We have a rich abundance of wild food on our doorstep in the Teviot valley, and Lilliard Gin aims to capture that and convey a true sense of the local flavour palette and our Borders 'terroir'.""
John Henderson, of Born in the Borders, said the gin distillery was a natural companion to the Scottish Borders Brewery on the site.
""To be able to play host to the first new distillery in the Borders in nearly 200 years is incredible,"" he said.
""And the fact that Lilliard Gin are looking to use Borders botanicals means they are completely in tune with our own ethos of local sourcing.
""We just can't wait for them to get started, and to taste their gin.""
The gin takes its name from a legendary Borders figure.
""Lilliard was the heroine of the Battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545, fought just north of the distillery,"" explained Ms Macinnes.
""Lilliard reputedly fought to avenge the death of her lover at the hands of the English. The battle site is also known as Lilliard's Edge.

"Fifa delegates are voting on their new president, but the incumbent Mr Blatter has refused to withdraw from the contest, despite the arrest of senior colleagues on major corruption charges.
The PM said Fifa could only rebuild its credibility if Mr Blatter left.
It comes as the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it was looking at material relating to the allegations.
Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on Wednesday.
The US Justice Department (DOJ) has charged 14 people with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
Mr Cameron's comments followed Mr Blatter's call for unity at Fifa as delegates prepare to vote on his presidency.
Mr Blatter, who is expected to win a fifth term, said: ""I am appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together.""
But speaking in Berlin, Mr Cameron said: ""You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward.
""That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go.
""And the sooner that happens the better - the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future.""
Mr Cameron, who is holding EU reform talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said it was ""unthinkable"" that Mr Blatter should stay.
He also said he would be ""guided"" by the Football Association (FA) chairman, Greg Dyke, over the question of whether the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be opened.
Mr Dyke suggested earlier that he would not rule out a boycott of the major football tournaments if Mr Blatter remains at the helm of Fifa.
The Union of European Football Associations (Uefa), Europe's governing body, may consider boycotting future World Cups if Mr Blatter wins Friday's vote, according to Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.
Meanwhile, the SFO said it was actively assessing ""material in its possession"" relating to Fifa corruption allegations.
It said it had ""made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations"".
It said its probe had been ongoing for months, before Wednesday's indictments.
Despite a global media and sporting storm, Fifa president Sepp Blatter is seeking re-election for a fifth term, with the only challenge coming from Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.
The vote is taking place at the Fifa World Congress meeting in Zurich, Switzerland.
The SFO said it was not willing to comment further on the nature of material in its possession or current activity in this area.
It added that it had not launched a formal criminal investigation.  But it said there were two ways in which it could get involved - if the SFO opened a formal criminal investigation itself or provided ""mutual legal assistance"" to overseas law enforcement.
It also says it has made plain to both US and Swiss authorities that it stands ready to assist.
""There are currently international criminal investigations into allegations of corruption at Fifa. As such it would be inappropriate for the SFO to comment on the matter at this time,"" it said.
In November the SFO asked for anyone with information regarding alleged corruption in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to come forward.

"Croydon NHS managers have decided to withdraw NHS prescriptions for formula feed to help reduce budget deficits.
Croydon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said the plan could save the NHS thousands of pounds per year.
Mother Sarah Rose however said it was ""like taking milk from a baby"" as her seven-month-old son Sam depended on it.
Richmond Clinical Commissioning Group is consulting about withdrawing formula prescriptions too and the consultation runs until 3 February.
It said: ""It is proposed that GPs no longer provide soya-based infant formula milk, thickened infant formulas or formulas for lactose intolerance on prescription as these are now widely available to buy from community pharmacies and supermarkets at a similar cost to standard infant formula.""
People who might be affected include those with cow's milk protein allergy and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, it warned, but it calculated this would provide a saving of £386,000 per year.
Standard formula milk costs about £10 for a week's supply and is available in supermarkets and chemists.
Miss Rose, a 33-year-old primary school support assistant and mother-of-two, said Sam had a prescription for the specialist formula that would otherwise cost £40 online for one tin that would feed him for about two and half days.
She said: ""The tins are about half the size of normal milk formula so it works out at eight times the price.""
""We haven't got a lot of money. This is not me being fussy, but it's like taking milk from a baby"", she said.
""We went to A&E twice before he [Sam] was diagnosed with this allergy at about four months. He was screaming in pain all the time. He arched his back and started refusing milk. Now he's a normal baby. I don't ever want to go back to that again.""
An online petition calling on the CCG to reverse its decision has attracted more than 6,000 signatures and charities, such as Allergy UK and Anaphylaxis Campaign, expressed their disappointment and urged a rethink.
Dr Tony Brzezicki, Clinical Chair of NHS Croydon CCG said: ""We share the public's concerns and we will do what we can to reduce the impact on the most vulnerable in our communities and to make sure funding is there for those with the greatest clinical need.""
He said the prescriptions would cease in the coming months and families would be given notice of the plans before the change took effect.
""These are very difficult decisions but we need to focus our limited resources where we can have the biggest impact on people's health and well-being,"" he added.","Parents of babies with milk and soya allergies could face charges of up to £112 per week to feed their children in London, it has been claimed.",38760732

"A 59-year-old teacher from London received £185,000 after she slipped a disc in her back after she was knocked to the ground by two unruly pupils.
A member of teaching staff in north Wales was given £100,000 compensation when the chair he sat on collapsed.
The NASUWTteaching union said it had won £16,077,328 for members last year.
A Department for Education spokesperson said:  ""School employers are responsible for the health and safety of staff and pupils whether the local authority, governing body or academy trust, and they must adhere to the Health and Safety Act 1974.""
Teachers also received smaller payouts over accidents in the workplace, including a £55,000 package for a female member of staff in north-west England who tripped on a tear in the lino surface of her science classroom.
She was later diagnosed with chronic back syndrome.
NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said many of the injuries would be reduced if employers ""took the welfare of staff seriously"" and followed good health and safety practices.
She said: ""The consequence of negligence is careers, lives and health blighted and millions of pounds of public money spent in compensation.
""Unfortunately, there is no incentive for employers to take health and welfare seriously when they witness the government cutting funding for inspection and failing to take steps to secure compliance with the law.
""Failure to respect the rights of employees and to comply with employment law is also prevalent.
""Employers flout the law, but it's the teachers and the taxpayers who pay the price.
""While compensation is important, it can never make up for the fact that teachers suffer permanent physical and mental injury and often cannot continue in their chosen career.""
Separate data from the NUT, which keeps its overall compensation figures private, said there were two cases of personal injury compensation paid to its members last year.
One included a £46,000 payout to a teacher who suffered ""severe psychological injury"" following ""a sustained campaign of bullying and harassment by senior leadership"".
Another NUT member was awarded just under £4,500 after she fractured a finger on a defective doorknob, causing her long-term aches and a deformity.

The man said his wife was ""hysterical"" at finding police in the garden.

The man was later released when police realised he was not the person they were looking for.

The officer who compiled the pack had recorded the name and address of another man of the same name, but had mistakenly added the complainant's date of birth.
The officer who co-ordinated the search said she had checked the details in the handover pack, but found no-one of that name living at the address.
She then searched for a more up-to-date address using the complainant's name and date of birth, which resulted in his arrest and home being searched.

"Employers with 11 or more parking spaces now have to pay Nottingham City Council £288 a year per space under the Workplace Parking Levy.
Many employers have decided to pass on some or all of the charge to their staff while some have reduced their numbers of car parking spaces.
Bristol City Council is considering a similar scheme.
The Nottingham scheme will raise £2m less than the council predicted because employers have registered fewer spaces than expected.
Among the employees avoiding the charge is Kofi Ohene-Djan from the Capital FM Arena.
""I'm going to be cycling in,"" he said.
""I live in Nottingham so I'm going to be on my bike.""
Mr Ohene-Djan's colleagues have been given the option of paying their employer £52 per year for a parking permit.
The arena will pay the remainder of the Workplace Parking Levy, which rises to £380 by 2015.
Motoring organisations the AA and the RAC both predicted that the scheme will damage the economy.
AA president Edmund King said: ""At a time when drivers are facing record prices at the pumps, further charges for parking at work are the last thing they need.
""This damaging 'tax on work' should be stopped from spreading elsewhere as it will damage the economy and hit employees who just can't afford it.""
Mr Ohene-Djan was asked if he wanted to pay for a permit when he started his job last month.
""I probably would have done a bit of both [cycling and driving] but I will definitely be on my bike now,"" he said.
Employers exempt from paying the levy include the Best Western Hotel, on Mansfield Road, Carrington.
General manager Phil Rea said: ""We are not affected because it only affects staff parking.
""At any one time I don't have more than seven staff cars on the car park.""
Employers have had to register spaces from 1 October, but charging was timed to begin from this financial year.
The council has introduced the levy to pay for transport improvements, including the extension of Nottingham's tram network.
Councillor Jane Urquhart, who is in charge of transport, said the council still expected to meet its target over the 23-year period of the levy, generating an average of £14m a year.
It will raise £8m this year rather than the £10m expected.
Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ""The council blames commuters for Nottingham's congestion, but people travelling in to the city to work make it the prosperous place it is.

""We know what we have to do. Make the ball available for him. He's a big man. Conor can look after himself,"" he said.
Asked whether Ireland will plan extra protection for his Munster colleague, Stander replied: ""No. No. He is a player that looks after himself. We just need to get the ball back from the ruck and make it easier for him to get the ball and let him play his game.
Scrum-half Murray, 27, claimed the Scottish club had put him at risk of injury in the European Champions Cup game at Scotstoun on 14 January.
Murray took a blow to the head during the contest and Munster were later cleared of any wrongdoing by Champions Cup organisers after the scrum-half had initially returned to the field following the incident before undergoing a head injury assessment.
In response, the Warriors' coaching staff and players were adamant that their tactics, while robust, were firmly within the laws of the game.
Scotland scrum-half Laidlaw stuck firmly to this line at a news conference on Tuesday.
Laidlaw said: ""Glasgow did everything within the rules of the game. As a nine you are always going to get teams putting pressure on you.

""In that game, Glasgow got a charge down on him but they were trying to get the ball back - they weren't trying to deliberately injure the player.
""Will we be putting pressure on him? For sure we will. He's not going to come to Murrayfield and get an armchair ride.
""We need to do that to every Irish player but we can expect the same back, I'm sure.""
For his part, Stander believes the Munster pack ""let down"" Murray at Scotstoun but he appears confident that there will not be a repetition at Murrayfield.
""We didn't look after him as much as we could [at Scotstoun]. This weekend, we all have to concentrate on our job.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is the first member of the UK Royal family to have his first birthday marked by a new coin.
The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July.
The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne.
It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014.
Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother.
Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: ""We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne.
""The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies...
""Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the £5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations.""
The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost £80 each from the Royal Mint.
The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown.
It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960.

Yorkshire Sculpture Park said visitor numbers would be restricted on 8 and 11 November ""to ensure a calm and contemplative experience for all"".

Our set-pieces were poor and we should have kept possession far better in open play. The midfield three who were meant to be supporting Kyle Lafferty did not get forward enough and, when he was up front on his own, he got no decent service at all.
Yes, Poland dominated the game but Northern Ireland are used to that happening and I could tell from listening to their captain Steven Davis talk after the final whistle that he also felt they should have done better with the ball at certain times.
You have got to remember these players are in the finals of a major tournament for the first time and maybe it will take them time to adapt to it.
It certainly looked as if they gave Poland a little bit too much respect, especially in the first half, but there were some positives, too - as a defensive unit, we were excellent.
For all of Poland's possession - and in the first half it was 68% - they did not batter Northern Ireland and it took them until the 29th minute to force Michael McGovern into a save.
Michael O'Neill's team were excellent at staying compact and forcing the ball into wider areas but, as I said to Gary Lineker at half-time, the 10-15 minutes after the interval were vital.
Unfortunately the Poles scored six minutes into the second half and I kind of saw it coming.
When your team has been defending and concentrating so much for the entire first 45 minutes, it is difficult to quickly get back up to the same levels again straight after the break and they just got caught cold.

Northern Ireland are usually big on set-plays whoever they play and they would have worked on them a lot in the run-up to this game because they know they are not going to play through teams at this level.
But apart from one well-worked free-kick where the ball just ran away from Davis in front of goal, they just did not nail them in Nice.
When O'Neill brought on Conor Washington in the second half and switched to playing two up front, we carried a bit more of a threat.
You could not question the effort and application of our players and the thousands of travelling fans, and everyone back home, should be very proud of them. Even so, Poland deserved to win.
It was a disappointing result but it has not changed much about the Ukraine game from a Northern Ireland point of view.
For me, they are not as strong as Poland or Germany and it was always the easiest-looking game in Group C.
If we want to qualify out of this group, then we are going to have to win in Lyon on Thursday.
How will we do it? Well, I think O'Neill might start out by being cautious to begin with.
He will want to keep his favoured three-centre-halves intact but I think he will be tempted to go with two strikers so a 3-5-2 formation would work. That is the approach I would favour.
Yes, we have lost our first match but one win could get us to the last 16 and, with Germany to play in our final group game, the best chance of us getting that will be against Ukraine.

"After a drab game with few chances for either side, Mohamed Salah teed up El Said, who struck firmly past Uganda keeper Denis Onyango on 89 minutes.
Uganda's Joseph Ochaya earlier had a goal correctly disallowed for offside.
The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake, while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978.
Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday.
On a deteriorating pitch in Port-Gentil, seven-times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cranes defence for long periods.
Onyango made an impressive clearing header to deny the onrushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half.
Uganda began the second half brightly, forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as Ochaya turned in Faruku Miya's through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes.
El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Marwan Mohsen went close for the Pharaohs with a header, but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw.
However, an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass, the substitute's close-range shot evading Onyango.
Uganda now face Mali in the final round of group games on Wednesday, with Mali needing a win and for Ghana to beat Egypt by two goals or more if they are to qualify.

"Among those detained is his brother-in-law and one of the two pilots who flew Guzman to his home state.
Mexico's attorney general said a member of Guzman's legal team, described as the mastermind, was also arrested.
Guzman, head of the Sinaloa cartel, escaped from a high-security prison through a specially dug tunnel.
Attorney General Arely Gomez told reporters on Wednesday that the suspected mastermind of the escape had repeatedly entered Altiplano prison to visit Guzman and update him on the operation's progress.
She also said Guzman's brother-in-law had supervised the construction of the mile-long escape tunnel and organised transport.
""Today we are able to affirm that the group responsible for planning, organising and carrying out the escape from outside the prison has been broken up,""  Ms Gomez said, without naming the suspects.
The development comes days after officials revealed the drugs lord had suffered face and leg injuries when he narrowly evaded a police operation to recapture him in north-west Mexico earlier this month.
Ms Gomez confirmed on Wednesday that after his escape, Guzman travelled by land to the city of Queretaro, from where he caught a small plane to his home state of Sinaloa.
His escape was an embarrassment for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, who Guzman taunted on Twitter after the event.
Several prison officials have already been arrested under suspicion of giving inside help to Guzman, who fled through a tunnel that ran 1.5km from under a shower in his cell to outside the prison.
Guzman was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and spent nearly a decade in another maximum-security Mexican jail before escaping, reportedly in a laundry basket.
He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014 after a series of high-profile arrests of associates and covert surveillance by the US authorities.",Mexico officials say they have arrested six key people who allegedly helped fugitive drug cartel leader Joaquin Guzman escape from jail in July.,34600467
"However, the report concluded there had been ""no overarching state conspiracy"".
Sir Desmond de Silva's review confirmed that agents of the state were involved in the 1989 killing and that it should have been prevented.
Mr Finucane's widow, Geraldine, has dismissed the report as a ""sham"" and a ""whitewash"".
Mr Finucane was shot dead by loyalists in front of his wife and children at his north Belfast home.
The review, published on Wednesday, found RUC officers proposed Mr Finucane, 39, be killed, said they passed information to his killers and failed to stop the attack and then obstructed the murder investigation.
It also found that an Army intelligence unit, the FRU, ""bears a degree"" of responsibility because one of their agents, Brian Nelson, was involved in selecting targets.
The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Matt Baggott, said the police fully accepted the findings of the report.
He offered a ""complete, absolute and unconditional"" apology to the Finucane family, saying they had been ""abjectly failed"".
He said that in the coming days the PSNI would discuss the report with the Police Ombudsman and the Public Prosecution Service.
Pat Finucane review reaction
""Pat Finucane's murder should never have happened and it is a catalogue of failing which now needs to be assessed to see whether there are people who can be held accountable,"" he said.
Mrs Finucane said the government had ""engineered a suppression of the truth"" behind her husband's murder.
His family have led a high-profile campaign for a full public inquiry into the murder but Mr Cameron has ruled that out.
Mrs Finucane said: ""At every turn, it is clear that this report has done exactly what was required - to give the benefit of the doubt to the state, its cabinet and ministers, to the Army, the intelligence services, to itself.
""At every turn, dead witnesses have been blamed, and defunct agencies found wanting.  Serving personnel and active state departments appear to have been excused.
""The dirt has been swept under the carpet without any serious attempt to lift the lid on what really happened to Pat and so many others.""
The Finucanes did not co-operate with the review and the solicitor's widow said the de Silva report did not tell her much more than she previously knew about the case.
Her son, Michael, claimed the government had refused their demand for a full inquiry because it did not want people to be questioned in public.
• There were extensive ""leaks"" of security force information to the UDA and other loyalist paramilitary groups.
• There was a failure by the authorities to act on threat intelligence.
• Employees of the State and State agents played ""key roles"" in the murder.
• There was a failure to investigate and arrest key members of the West Belfast UDA over a long period of time.
• There was a wider ""relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice"" after the murder had taken place.
Sir Desmond found that ""senior Army officers deliberately lied to criminal investigators"" and that RUC Special Branch ""were responsible for seriously obstructing the investigation"".
The report concluded that Nelson did not provide his handlers with details of the plot against Mr Finucane.
It found that MI5 received intelligence two months before the killing that Mr Finucane was under threat but that no steps were taken to protect him.
It also found that MI5 helped spread propaganda against Mr Finucane in the years before he was killed.
Sir Desmond found that ""in 1985 the security service assessed that 85% of the UDA's 'intelligence' originated from sources within the security forces"".
And he was ""satisfied that this proportion would have remained largely unchanged"" by the time of Mr Finucane's murder.""
Sir Desmond de Silva QC carried out the review at the government's request. The Finucanes want a public inquiry as they feared the full truth would not emerge.
In his report Sir Desmond said: ""A series of positive actions by employees of the state actively furthered and facilitated his murder and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice.
""My review of the evidence relating to Patrick Finucane's case has left me in no doubt that agents of the state were involved in carrying out serious violations of human rights up to and including murder.
""However, despite the different strands of involvement by elements of the state, I am satisfied that they were not linked to an over-arching state conspiracy to murder Patrick Finucane.""
Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Cameron was strongly critical of the RUC and Army for their conduct in relation to the killing.
He said Sir Desmond concluded that there was ""no political conspiracy"" over the murder but that ""ministers were misled"".
Mr Cameron added that the report found ""no evidence whatsoever that any government minister had fore-knowledge of Mr Finucane's murder"".
He said that on behalf of the government and the whole country he wanted to say to the Finucane family that he was ""deeply sorry"".
Last year, Mr Cameron acknowledged there was state collusion in Mr Finucane's murder and apologised to his family.
In the report, Sir Desmond found that an account one of the murderers, Ken Barrett, gave to the BBC Panorama programme about receiving intelligence from the RUC was ""essentially accurate"".
However, he added that some specific allegations made by Barrett against individual officers were not reliable.
Former Ulster Unionist MP Lord Maginnis of Drumglass said the apology was ""ridiculous"".
""The reality is that the Finucane family were an IRA family and I can illustrate that by saying that, when I gave that allegation publicly and was being sued for libel, the family retracted and paid my legal expenses,"" he told the House of Lords.
""So let's not fool ourselves about the godfather Finucane, who was killed.""","The level of state collusion uncovered by a report into the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane is ""shocking"", Prime Minister David Cameron has said.",20662412

"As Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders clashed in their first one-on-one debate it was the senator from Vermont who started to trend worldwide.
So what are Bernie's supporters doing differently to bolster his support amongst younger voters? One place where he is a surprising hit is the dating app Tinder.
Kevin Smit from Alkmaar in the Netherlands has used Tinder to spread the Bernie gospel. ""I'm not a heterosexual male and I too believe he's sexy"" he joked to BBC News.
""He's a hit because there's a lot of millennials on the app and he polls amazingly with them"".
Fans of Bernie's Tinder triumphs share their success on Facebook and Tumblr.
Logan Jantzi from New York told BBC News that it was Bernie's policies which lead to his Tinder appeal.
""He discusses problems that are of actual concern to young voters""  he said.
""Gender inequality, low wages, high student loan debt, climate change, these are the things that 18-30 somethings are concerned with.""
Nelson Evans, a Bernie Sanders supporter from California, told BBC News that the popularity of Bernie on social media was because his supporters didn't think their candidate received enough attention in traditional media.
""There's people who even pay the full Tinder membership fees in order to reach others across the country"" he said.
""I think it's effective because, prior to the Iowa caucus, the media has completely shut Bernie out of the news cycle. For every 81 minutes of election coverage he'd get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that.""
""But people who get their election news from the mainstream media, they have no idea what Bernie is all about. That's sort of what started the Tinder thing.
""It's amazing how you see people from 17-29 who have gone from never being interested in politics to being completely enveloped by it.
""This election represents more than just a candidate. It's an indication that the youth know what direction they want our country to go, and they're ready to work vigorously for it,"" he added.
The hashtag #demdebate has been used more than 600,000 times over the past 24 hours to discuss the debate between Clinton and Sanders:
Both candidates have their names shortened on Twitter to fit with the platform's character limit.
Hillary Clinton is commonly called '#HRC' by supporters, a term which has featured in more than 49,700 tweets over the past 24 hours while the term #Bernie far surpassed that and was used in 322,000 tweets.
On Facebook, Bernie Sanders' personal page has almost three million likes while Hillary Clinton is only able to manage 2.3 million.
But his popularity on social sites won't necessarily translate into Bernie Sanders becoming the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

"Neil Ward, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales Trust, said the diminishing sports budget was leading to ""unrealistic"" expectations.
The Welsh Government said it was ""totally committed to making Wales a more healthy and active nation"".
But its funding via Sport Wales has fallen by 14% in the past seven years.
Mr Ward told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme he was concerned about the limit to what could be achieved with the Sport Wales budget of about £22m a year.
His comments came a year after Wales' historic quarter-final win over Belgium at Euro 2016.
Mr Ward said the FAW had committed to investing its profit from the tournament - about £4m - in infrastructure projects which would benefit grassroots football in Wales.
But he said more public money was needed too.
""The government is going to be asking the sport sector to do more with the £20m that it presently receives, and to expect sport to do even more with what is a diminishing budget is unrealistic.""
""This is a public health issue,"" Mr Ward added.
""If we don't protect the facilities we get, if we continue to increase facility charges, it means those who are less well will have to pay more.
""They're probably going to disengage further from physical activity and we know there are a million people in Wales who are physically inactive.""
The FAW Trust said the number of registered young players in Wales had increased over the past year with 900 more boys playing the game and 1,100 more girls.
Former Wales international and FAW Trust board member Prof Laura McAllister told the programme the biggest problem was finding places for them to play.
""It's no good them being enthused by Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen if then when they go out and try and play there aren't sufficient pitches for them to enjoy the game,"" she said.
""There was a lot of celebration amongst our politicians as much as amongst the public for the success that we saw in the Euros but there has to come a time where we put our money where our mouths are.""
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""What we must continue to focus on is looking at different ways of working together to maximise our investment in sport and physical activity, and deliver greater outcomes so we translate existing participation levels into lifelong physical activity habits and encourage those who live a sedentary lifestyle to become more active.
""We also recognise the importance of ensuring that there are better quality facilities for people to take part in sport and physical activity and are undertaking a facility review so we gain a better understanding of our priorities for the future.""

"They have trained wild monitor lizards, known locally as goannas, not to eat the toxic amphibians.
They did this by feeding the reptiles small, less potent cane toads. Many that tried the toads once did not make the same mistake again.
The researchers say that extending the trial could help the continent's wildlife.
The study is published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.
Lead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear, from the University of Sydney, said: ""We've been very surprised by the results, by the amount of time that some of these lizards have actually retained this knowledge and survived in the presence of a high-density of cane toads, which is basically unheard of in the wild.""
Cane toads were introduced to Australia in the 1930s to control sugar cane pests.
But the subsequent spread has been unstoppable, devastating the continent's animals.
Among the hardest hit are the yellow-spotted monitors (Varanus panoptes).   Their population is estimated to have plummeted by 90%.
When the toads invade a new area, these yellow-and-black-spotted reptiles feast on the amphibians, and subsequently die.
""A goanna only has to mouth a toad for less than 30 seconds and it can kill them,"" said Dr Ward-Fear.
""This species is quite abundant in ecosystems ahead of a cane toad invasion, and then as we see the invasion move through, they are basically wiped out of the landscape.""
In the trials, the researchers tracked down wild lizards before the toads descended.
Dr Ward-Fear explained: ""We presented them with a small toad via our very technical apparatus: a telescopic fishing pole. The toad had a little cotton belt attached to it.
""We sidled up to the goanna in a very stealthy manner and extended the fishing pole.""
The young toads made the lizards sick, but were not toxic enough to do lasting harm.
The scientists then attached radio transmitters to follow the goannas as the amphibians arrived in the area.
Many of the 16 lizards who'd already tasted toad did not make the same mistake again - and more than half survived during the 18-month study period.
The team also followed 31 ""untrained"" lizards that had not eaten the toads.
""We saw the goannas that had not had a negative experience with the small toad died very quickly. They all died within three months of the natural cane toad invasion arriving at the site. At the end of the study, every untrained goanna had died.""
The scientists say the study suggests goannas have the ability to learn from experience and retain that knowledge over a long period of time.
Dr Ward-Fear said: ""This study provides the proof of principle that this strategy could be very effective. Employing it in the wild could potentially have a really large positive impact on the goanna population.""

"The pair shared a partnership of 187 after Nick Compton and Stevie Eskinazi fell in quick succession.
Stirling's century was his first in a Championship match and he made 111 before falling lbw to Adil Rashid.
Robson was dropped on 31 by Jack Brooks and was still there on 152 not out at the close, with Middlesex 337-4.
Yorkshire went into the game second in the Division One table, just six points behind leaders Essex, with Middlesex down in sixth place and minus Dawid Malan, Nick Gubbins and Tom Helm, who are all on international duty.
The home side, who won the title by beating Yorkshire in the corresponding match last season, opted to bat first after winning the toss and Compton put on 64 for the first wicket with Robson before a thin edge to the keeper off Steve Patterson saw him depart for 22.
Eskinazi was bowled by Brooks five overs later, but the Yorkshire paceman had crucially been unable to hold onto a low caught-and-bowled chance offered by Robson.
The opener was first to three figures following the tea interval, and although Stirling departed when he missed an attempted pull to a ball that kept slightly low and James Franklin was bowled by Ryan Sidebottom, he passed 150 with a boundary off Rashid - the 18th of his innings - in the final over of play.
Middlesex batsman Paul Stirling told BBC Radio London:
""It's about time I did this and also about time I started to score more consistently. That said, I don't want to take away my natural instinct to play attacking cricket. That's the balance I have to find.
""Our skipper James Franklin has given me freedom to go in and play at the same sort of tempo as I would in one-day cricket and transfer that into the red-ball game.
""When the pitches are as flat as they have been at Lord's it's a little easier to do that and I'm glad it came off.""
Yorkshire head coach Martyn Moxon told BBC Radio Leeds:
""It's been a tough day, what with the weather and a pitch that's pretty benign. The lads stuck to their task really well.
""A few nicks fell short and some very close lbw decisions didn't go out way. It was a frustrating day, but I can't fault the lads for their efforts.

"Bernard Kenny, 78, was stabbed as he intervened when Thomas Mair attacked Mrs Cox in his home village of Birstall, West Yorkshire, a year ago.
PCs Craig Nicholls and Jonathan Wright - who arrested Mair - have also received Queen's Gallantry Medals.
Unarmed, they pursued him despite knowing he may have a gun and a knife.

After the attack more than 80,000 people signed an online petition calling for Mr Kenny to be awarded the George Cross for his bravery.
At Mair's trial at the Old Bailey, the jury heard Mr Kenny was waiting for his wife outside the library in Birstall when he saw Mair going ""berserk"".
He said in statement to police: ""I thought if I could jump on to the back I could take him down.
""I thought he was thumping her until I saw the blood. I saw he had a knife in his hands.
""Just as I got short of him, he turned around and saw me. He shoved the knife in and it hit me in the stomach. The blood started pouring out between my fingers. I saw the blood and I thought 'Oh my God'.""
Mr Kenny said: ""I am honoured to receive such an award.""
After the attack, Mair left the scene armed with a knife and a gun and was followed by PC Nicholls and PC Wright.

"Ten-month-old Laith Atiga was crawling at his grandmother's home, in Berkshire, when he suddenly started coughing.
""I turned to check on him and found that he was struggling to breathe,"" his mother, Jude, said.
""He turned blue and started to froth.
""His eyes started to roll.""
Emergency staff responded to Jude's 999 call, and gave Laith oxygen.
""Laith was doing well and even playing and laughing,"" his mother said.
""Ambulance staff asked me to give him a drink and he seemed to struggle with it, so they decided to take us to hospital because they suspected something was stuck.""
The family was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, but an X-ray came back clear.
The following day, 1 August, Laith became unwell with a fever and no appetite, but by 3 August he had recovered.
Then, he took a turn for the worse.
""I tried to feed him, and that's when I realised something was still seriously wrong,"" Jude said.
""He chewed his food as usual but very quickly regurgitated it in chewed form.""
Jude took Laith back to hospital, where he was diagnosed with tonsillitis.
""I was given a local anaesthetic to spray at the back of Laith's throat 20 minutes before meals, to help him swallow,"" she said.
""Although I wasn't convinced, I tried the spray and Laith still struggled to swallow.
""I thought it best to give him a break from solids and started only giving him pureed soups and milkshakes.
""I continued to do this for two more days.""
But a few days later, after Laith regurgitated more food, Jude, who lives in New York, panicked.
""It happened shortly before bedtime,"" she said.
""And had he not regurgitated it then, it could have caused him to choke in his sleep.
""I decided to call his doctors in New York, as I had completely lost faith in the NHS.
""They told me to stop giving him solids completely as they are a serious choking hazard and only to give him liquids or stage-one pureed foods.""
The family travelled back to the US and went to a hospital in New York, where Laith was again X-rayed and seen by an ear, nose and throat specialist.
But, once again, everything came back clear.
""They concluded that if there was something, it must be in the oesophagus,"" Jude said.
""We were admitted, and at 08:00 on Saturday, 13 August, Laith was operated on, and a plastic angel, measuring almost 2cm [0.7in], was found in his oesophagus.""
Jude said: ""I am still so traumatised by the whole experience.
""Ultimately, I shouldn't have had to chase after medical providers for answers.
""The duty of care given to children and babies should never be compromised.
""My child should not have had to suffer in such discomfort for as long as he did.""
A Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust representative said: ""We were sorry to hear, through the BBC, of the young patient's experience - but the family has not been in touch with the trust about this issue since their return to America.
""We have raised this issue and are investigating it - but, to progress it further, it would be helpful if the family made formal contact with our patient liaison team directly.
""This would help us to review the care given and let the family know of any outcomes.""
Jude contacted the BBC via WhatsApp.

"It reveals that those aged 60 and over are the fastest growing population in English and Welsh prisons, with an increase of 146% between 2002 and 2014.
Those aged 50-59 are the second fastest-growing group, says the report.
The government said it was ""committed to providing suitable facilities"".
The report comes as Prisons Minister Andrew Selous is due to give evidence on older prisoners to the Commons justice select committee.
Longer sentences mean more people are growing frail in prison, but high rates of social and support needs are unmet, says the trust.
Two in five prisoners over 50 now have a disability of some kind, the report added.
Trust director Juliet Lyon said: ""In the last few years, prison has been reduced to a punitive holding operation for people growing older and sicker behind bars.
""Prisons are less safe and less decent than they were even a year ago when we published our last report.
""An incoming administration of government in May 2015 must not accept this deterioration in prison standards and conditions as the new normal.""
Although the prison population stands at around 84,500 in England and Wales - 20% higher than it was 12 years ago - the National Offender Management Service has had to make more than Â£700m in savings over the last three years and is expected cut a further Â£149m in 2014-15.

"The department is funding redundancies for 212 staff who have already applied to leave before the 2015/16 academic year.
It has told a further 285 staff they can leave during the year.
Those taking redundancy include lecturers and college support staff.
If all the staff go that will reduce the further education workforce in Northern Ireland, which stands at about 4,100 full-time equivalent staff, by just over 12%.
The cost of the redundancies was due to be funded under the civil service voluntary exit scheme.
As part of the Stormont House Agreement, the £700m scheme's future is uncertain due to the Northern Ireland Executive's continuing discord over welfare reform.
DEL Minister Stephen Farry has now decided to use his department's budget to fund the initial 212 applications.
That will cost £9.4m.
Mr Farry said that, in the absence of the voluntary exit scheme being agreed, he may also use his department's budget to meet the costs of the additional 285 staff who have been made offers to leave later in the academic year.
He said the initial 212 redundancies would save his department money in the long run.
""We will be finding a saving of £7.5m year after year, so it makes sense to proceed even though there is a degree of risk,"" he said.
""In the event a decision is taken on the main scheme for the public sector as a whole, then we hopefully will be able to backdate the money out of that scheme itself.""
He said that colleges had prepared for the reductions in staff.
""If you look at the further education sector, they have a very heavy proportion of their budget spent on staffing themselves,"" he said.
""So whenever we pass on, very regrettably, cuts to the sector, they've very little alternative than to look at their staffing complement.
""But I'm confident the sector can respond very positively to this.
""We've worked closely with the colleges and the trade unions, and I think everyone understands this is something we have to go through to ensure we have a modern, fit for purpose, public sector.""
Mr Farry also said it was important he acted now to end uncertainty for colleges and staff.
""If I was to stand back and allow this situation to drift over the summer, we would be a year delayed in making those efficiencies, and there would be many more costs to be borne by the sector itself.""
The department's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, from £756m to £694m.
As a result, the further education sector faces budget cuts of £12m.
The initial 212 staff had ended the summer term unsure if they would have to return to work, but were told on 9 July that their redundancy applications had been approved.
They are entitled to a redundancy payment of one month's gross salary for every year of service, up to a maximum of 21 months, as part of the process.
About a quarter of further education staff - more than 1,100 - had initially expressed interest in the voluntary redundancy scheme.
The Stormont House Agreement included plans for the Northern Ireland Executive to borrow up to £700m over four years to fund the scheme.
Of that figure, £200m was to be made available to fund public sector voluntary redundancies in 2015/16.
As a result of the uncertainty over the agreement, many public sector staff are unsure whether they will be allowed to take redundancy in September.
More than 7,000 civil servants have expressed interest in the scheme and 1,200 of those have been told they can leave, depending on funding.
DEL is the second executive department to decide to use its own budget to fund redundancies for some staff, in the absence of agreement on the wider scheme.

"The sceptics insist that growth has been largely jobless and deepened inequality in an already hierarchical society.
The optimistic refute this gloomy thesis and believe that the rising tide has lifted all boats.
As an example, they point to the emergence of a small but growing class of Dalit (formerly known as untouchables, the lowest in India's wretched caste hierarchy) millionaires.
So much so that Dalit activists like Chandra Bhan Prasad like to call it  a ""golden period"" for Dalits where ""material markers are replacing social markers"".
Studies have also shown that the wage gap between Dalits and other castes have narrowed and their standing has improved. There is even a Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
But new research by Lakshmi Iyer, Tarun Khanna and Ashustosh Varshney paints a less rosy picture.
Delving into the relationship between caste and entrepreneurship, the researchers have found that scheduled castes and tribes, the most disadvantaged groups in Hinduism's hierarchy, owned very little businesses despite a decade of sprightly economic growth and a long history of affirmative action.
Mining information thrown up by the 2005 economic census covering more than 42 million enterprises, they found schedule castes owned only 9.8% of all enterprises in India in 2005, well below their 16.4% share of the total population.
The scheduled tribes owned only 3.7% of non-farm enterprises despite being 7.7% of the population.
However, ownership of business among OBC's - an acronym for Other Backward Castes or the ""middle castes"" who ""neither suffering the extreme social and economic discrimination of the Scheduled Castes, nor enjoying the social privileges of the upper castes"" - has grown.
OBCs comprise 41% of India's people. Their members owned 43.5% of all enterprises in 2005, and accounted for 40% of non-farm employment.
This is a remarkable achievement considering that affirmative action for this group was widely introduced only in the 1990s.
The pattern of dismally low ownership of businesses among the most disadvantaged groups, the researchers found, is not specific to any one region or state in India.
Even in states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra that were among the first to have social movements to end caste discrimination, ownership of enterprises is low.
States with high population of the disadvantaged groups also show that they are under-represented in ownership of businesses.
The researchers say there could be a host of reasons - caste discrimination itself (members of other castes refuse to work with the lowest castes), lack of knowledge, illiteracy, and problems with securing finance.
""All these factors,"" they say, ""can prevent scheduled castes from entering industries that have significant economies of scale.""
Growth possibilities are limited by differences in the size of worker networks -  scheduled caste owners find it easier to work with scheduled caste workers.
I asked Dr Varshney, who teaches at the US's Brown University, whether the findings really came as a surprise, given that deeper social changes in societies like India take a lot of time.
He said he wasn't.
""I should, however, add that the story of the rise of the Dalit millionaires is not small either. Though numerically insignificant, it is politically, economically and socially very significant,"" he told me.
Over time, he believes, the rise of Dalits ""may well become comparable"" to the rise of Nadars - a southern caste - in Tamil Nadu.
Until about 150 years ago Nadars - mostly ""toddy tappers"" - were condemned to a near untouchable status. Today, they are a leading business community in the state and are found in all classes.
I asked Dr Varshney whether increased representation in politics had anything to do with higher ownership of business for different caste groups? I cited the example of the increasingly influential OBC-led politics in the country.
""Whether that happens remains unclear. The correlation undoubtedly exists, but the causes are still to be sorted out,"" he said.
I also wondered why decades of affirmative action and more than two decades of economic liberalisation hadn't still unleashed entrepreneurial energies among the most disadvantaged.
""Such transformations can take a long time,"" he said. ""The rise of the Nadars, for example, took nearly eight to 10 decades, depending on how one defines the rise.""",The story of India's economic surge is dominated by two conflicting narratives.,21972989

Head of state, prime minister: King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud
The Al Saud dynasty holds a monopoly of political power. Saudi Arabia was established in 1932 by King Abd-al-Aziz and he has been succeeded by various sons.
King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud ascended the throne in January 2015 following the death of his half-brother, King Abdullah.
He has been part of the ruling clique of princes for decades and is thought likely to continue the main thrusts of Saudi strategic policy, including maintaining the alliance with the United States and working towards energy market stability.
Saudi investors are major players in the pan-Arab TV industry, but the country has one of the region's most tightly-controlled media environments.
The government openly acknowledges that widespread internet filtering takes place. It targets ""pornographic"", Islam-related, human rights and political sites.
Saudi Arabia has the highest per-capita YouTube use of any country in the world. It is reportedly home to more than 40% of all active Twitter users in the Arab region.
Some key events in Saudi Arabia's history:
1932 - The areas controlled by King Abd-al-Aziz are unified under the name Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
1938 - Oil is discovered and production begins under the US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company).
1960 - Saudi Arabia is a founding member of Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries).
1973 - Saudi Arabia leads an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the October War against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadruple.
2001 11 September - 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in attacks on New York and Washington are Saudi nationals.
2011 - As ''Arab Spring'' protests ripple across the region, Saudi troops participate in crackdown on unrest in Bahrain.

"It follows 55,000 job cuts announced earlier this year.
The losses will come in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which is splitting from the printer and PC business.
The company says the cuts will save $2.7bn (Â£1.76bn) in annual costs, although the plan will cost $2.7bn to carry out.
At a meeting for Wall Street analysts, chairman and chief executive Meg Whitman said: ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""
The new structure proposed by Ms Whitman sees HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market.
The company currently has more than 300,000 employees.
""The number is sadly larger than some people might have expected, but I think it's a reflection of how much trouble HP has been having with its services,"" said Charles King, analyst at the Silicon Valley IT consulting firm Pund-IT.
""I'm frankly not sure if HP is finished with the layoffs.""
The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce.
The proportion of workers in what HPE calls ""low-cost locations"" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018.
The tech company has struggled over the last decade to keep up with changing demands as customers move away from desktop computers.
However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn.

"Released by Norwich City as a schoolboy, he entered semi-professional football, turning out for King's Lynn and Staines Town, who play in the Ryman Premier Division.
It was there, in the foothills of the English game, that he looked west and decided to move to the United States.
Dwyer signed up to a firm who - for a fee - help organise soccer scholarships at US colleges for young, talented British footballers.
Getting a scholarship means the college pays some, or all, of the student's tuition fees and costs.
The firm, Soccer Icon USA, held a trial at QPR's training ground, to see whether those who had signed up were good enough for college soccer.
""I think I scored a hat-trick in the first 10 minutes,"" remembers Dwyer, now 25.
""The coaches took me off early and said: 'So - whereabouts in America do you want to go?'""
Dwyer spent two years at Tyler Junior College in Texas, before moving to the University of South Florida.
While there, he was signed by Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City. He has since scored more than 30 MLS goals, was named in the 2014 All Star team alongside Thierry Henry and, in 2015, is on a guaranteed salary of more than £300,000 a year.
He is also married to Sydney Leroux, who was a member of the USA's World Cup-winning women's team earlier this year.
""It's pretty amazing,"" says Dwyer. ""I'm a little kid from England, and last year I was at the White House [after winning the 2013 MLS Cup].
""I just thought: 'What are they doing, letting me in here?'""
Dwyer is not the only British player who has gone from US college to the MLS.
Matt Watson - who studied at the University of Maryland, after being released by Wolves as a youngster - plays for Chicago Fire.
Otis Earle, son of former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle, is at FC Dallas, via the University of California, Riverside.
Preston-born Luke Mulholland, who studied in North Carolina, is at Real Salt Lake, while Andy Rose, once a Bristol City youth, went from the University of California in Los Angeles to Seattle Sounders.
Few Britons will emulate their careers. But more and more are trying.
According to the Fulbright Commission, almost 11,000 British students were at American colleges in the past academic year - an increase of 21% in the past 10 years.
Although the number of soccer scholarships is not recorded (there's no American equivalent of Ucas, the organisation through which applications are processed in England and Wales) it is clear they are becoming more popular.
Chris Cousins, who runs Sports Recruiting USA, went to Illinois on a soccer scholarship in 2003.
""I was probably one of a dozen going to America, if that,"" he says.
Now, he estimates that more than 600 British students - male and female - will cross the Atlantic to start soccer scholarships this year.
Cousins thinks rising tuition fees in England is one factor, having increased from £1,100 in 2003 to a maximum of £9,000 a year now. He also thinks social media has played a part.
""When you see your mate on Twitter or Facebook playing in California or Florida, it makes it more tempting,"" said Cousins.
College soccer is certainly attractive: in 2013, more than 30 teams had average attendances of more than 1,000, 10 with more than a 2,000 average, with some derbies attracting over 10,000 fans. To put that in perspective, last season English League Two sides Morecambe and Accrington both averaged less than 2,000.
The biggest games are shown on national television, and there is a clear route to turning pro: every year, MLS clubs take their pick of the best college players via the superdraft.
But there is another reason why more Britons are heading to American colleges - the rise in companies, or middlemen, who arrange soccer scholarships.
Pass4Soccer, which began in 2003, was one of the first. According to their latest annual report, they now have 40 competitors.
""It seems in the past 12 years they've sprung up left, right, and centre,"" said Daniel Gray, a director at the company.
""Five years ago, there were 10 or 15. Now there are 40. People are jumping on the bandwagon.""
Each firm is different but, broadly, the model is the same. Students pay a fee, and the company gets them a place at a US college - if they are good enough on the pitch and are capable of getting a degree.
The companies' fees vary. Sports Recruiting USA, one of the cheapest, charges £999; Pass4Soccer is £1,295; others charge more than £2,000.
The firms claim it is money well spent - they say, with contacts and experience, they are able to get better scholarships for their students.
Pass4Soccer, for example, estimate that 15% of their students get full scholarships - meaning the college pays all of the student's fees and living costs.
Sports Recruiting USA say their students, on average, get 90% scholarships - leaving students to pay just 10%.
When a year at a US college costs the average international student more than £20,000, paying £1,000 or £2,000 to a firm could be a wise investment.
But, as one QPR player knows, not everyone needs a middleman.
When Tyler Blackwood was 18, he had - in his own words - ""given up"".
As a schoolboy, Tottenham Hotspur said he was too short. Watford said the same, as did Northampton Town.
After a growth spurt, Blackwood, who is now over 6ft, was invited to a trial game at lower-league Barnet.
But, on the day of the game, the manager Paul Fairclough resigned and his trial never happened. Instead, he began working in his dad's bar in Oakwood, north London.
""It was a horrible year,"" remembers Blackwood. ""I had friends in the pro game, and I was watching them make their debuts.
""Football had always been my plan, then suddenly I realised - it's not going to happen.""
When his dad encouraged him to kickstart his career at an American college, they paid for a firm to arrange a scholarship.
""But the offers were from bad schools in terrible states,"" says Blackwood. ""In the end, I got my money back and did it myself.""
In 2011, the family went on holiday to Florida, so Blackwood emailed the soccer coach at the University of Tampa, asking for a trial.
The college accepted him, but offered only a 25% scholarship.
""My dad borrowed money, took out loans, to make sure he could pay the rest,"" says Blackwood, now 24.
""I told him he'd only have to pay for the first year, and then I'd get a full scholarship. And I did.""
This summer, Blackwood returned to England for a trial at QPR. It was successful, and he made his debut in August, away to Yeovil in the League Cup.
He is completing his four-year degree in London, taking his laptop on the team bus to catch up with work.
""I recently had an exam that started at 8pm, Florida time,"" says Blackwood.
""That was 1am in the UK. I'm looking forward to graduating, put it that way.""
As Blackwood shows, the quality of British players heading to America, as well as the quantity, is increasing.
Cousins says that, 10 years ago, it was ""county players getting the best scholarships - now it's people getting released from Chelsea and Manchester City"".
But what do British players offer that Americans - or other nationalities - do not?
""Work ethic sets them apart,"" says Steve Clements, who coached Dom Dwyer at Tyler Junior College in Texas.
""I must have had 100 British players, and they've always been hard-working. For example, nobody outworked Dom.
""Fantastic player, fantastic person, and a good friend. At Christmas, I came into my office and there he was, on a surprise visit.
""He didn't even tell me he was coming. He's that sort of guy.""
And, says Clements, the British bring something else to the team, as well as hard work.
""The Brits have fantastic humour. They're sarcastic, you know? And they can play.""
For those who do not make it professionally, the college degree is a decent consolation.
Graduates from soccer scholarships move into a range of careers: one of Clements's former British students works for Bank of America, another supplies souvenirs to major league sports (""If you need a number one finger, I know who to call,"" he says).
Joe Prince-Wright went on a soccer scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh and came back with two degrees: one in communication, and one in English writing.
Those qualifications helped him become a website editor for the American network, NBC, in London.
""Academically, college was an eye-opener,"" he says.
""You only focus on your main subject in the last two years, so I was doing algebra classes, astronomy classes, everything.
""We'd have classes, train for three hours a day, then have more classes. On a Friday you might fly three hours to Tampa, and have a game there.
""On a Saturday, you'd fly four hours to Chicago, train, play on the Sunday, fly back, then start another week of classes.
""It was like being a full-time student and a professional soccer player.""
One man who values a college education is Dwyer, who turned professional before finishing his degree in communications and psychology.
However, despite his fame and fortune, he plans to complete his course, graduate, and finish the adventure he started six years ago.","Six years ago, Dom Dwyer's career was going nowhere.",34097904
"Jenny Stephen expected BT to connect her home to a telegraph pole visible from her window at a holiday village in Corton, Suffolk.

"County Londonderry man Smyth, 25, is continuing his preparations for the Paralympics in London where he will defend his T13 100m and 200m titles.
However, Smyth is already thinking ahead to the 2016 Olympics in Rio.
""I want to give it another really good shot over the next four years and get what I didn't get this year,"" he said.
Smyth's 100m personal best of 10.22 set last year was only four one-hundredths of a second (0.04secs) outside the qualifying time for the London Olympics.
The visually-impaired sprinter based himself largely in Florida for the past three years as he chased Olympic qualification before time ran out on his bid last month.
Smyth became the first paralympic athlete ever to compete at a European Championships in Barcelona in 2010 and his progression on the able-bodied circuit continued last year when he was selected for the World Championships in Daegu.
The 25-year-old remains determined to reach his Olympic goal in Rio even though the 100m qualifying mark for the Games in Brazil may be even quicker than the London A standard of 10.18.
""At one stage, I was wondering whether I wanted to keep going but I want to reach my potential and I haven't done that yet,"" added Smyth whose has less than 10 per cent of normal sight because of the Stargardt's condition.
""Europeans and World Championships are good stepping stones to try and compete at the Olympics and I will be aiming to compete in those events in the run-up to Rio as well my normal paralympic competitions.""
Smyth has still to work out his coaching arrangements after the paralympics with his current mentor Stephen Maguire moving to take up a new role with Scottish Athletics in the autumn.
""I don't know yet for sure. I'm looking at probably going back to the States and hopefully getting a new coaching situation sorted out with a view towards aiming for Rio,"" added Smyth, who is currently in Portugal at a pre-Paralympics Team Ireland training camp.

He had argued the law only required children to attend school regularly.
The council said it wanted to know why the court decided there was no case to answer.
Mr Platt, a solicitor, took his daughter on holiday with the extended family, despite an absence request being rejected by the school.
At a magistrates' court earlier this month he successfully argued Section 444 of the Education Act required parents ensured their children attended school ""regularly"", and did not put restrictions on taking them on holidays in term time.

"Bishop Geoffrey Robinson told a national inquiry the Church had failed to speak out strongly about the abuse.
The bishop played an important role in developing the Australian church's response to the issue in the 1990s.
Australia is holding a national inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.
Popes and archbishops, including the Vatican's finance chief, Australian Cardinal George Pell, had sent out the ""wrong message"" about the issue, Bishop Robinson told the inquiry on Monday.
""I think that some popes gave out the wrong message ... and some archbishops too,"" local media reported Bishop Robinson telling the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.
Bishop Robinson said Pope John Paul II did not immediately condemn the abuse claims when they emerged in the 1990s.
""We still haven't had that kind of leadership, not even from (Pope) Francis,"" he said, explaining that bishops followed the Vatican's line by remaining silent on the issues.
Bishop Robinson said that while he was drafting a national response for the Australian Catholic Church to abuse victims in 1990s, the then Archbishop of Melbourne, Cardinal Pell, released his own protocol for Melbourne.
Unlike the national strategy, it required alleged sex abuse victims to speak to church lawyers first.
""(Pell) would later claim that this meant he was the first person in Australia to have such a protocol,"" said Bishop Robinson.

"In the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, where the threat of attack is considered greatest, the UK, France and Germany have also shut their embassies.
The British embassy has emptied completely, with all remaining British staff leaving the country on Tuesday, while the US air force flew out American personnel.
So just what is it about al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen that triggers such warning bells in Washington?
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, is not the biggest offshoot of the late Osama Bin Laden's organisation, nor is it necessarily the most active - there are other, noisier jihadist cells sprawled across Syria and Iraq, engaged in almost daily conflict with fellow Muslims.
But Washington considers AQAP to be by far the most dangerous to the West because it has both technical skills and global reach.
Plus it is loyal to the nominal al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and what remains of the group's core leadership hiding in Pakistan.
For the West, AQAP presents three dangers:
AQAP has form. In August 2009, its master bomb-maker Ibrahim al-Asiri, a Saudi national, built an explosive device so hard to detect it was either packed flat next to the wearer's groin or perhaps even concealed inside his body.
He then sent his brother Abdullah, a willing volunteer, as a human bomb to blow up the Saudi prince in charge of counter-terrorism. He very nearly succeeded.
Pretending he wanted to give himself up, Abdullah al-Asiri fooled Saudi security into letting him get right next to Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef before the device was detonated, possibly remotely by mobile phone.
The blast blew the bomber in half, but with most of the explosive force directed downwards, the prince had a miraculous escape with only a damaged hand. AQAP boasted that it would try again and it did.
In December 2009, Ibrahim al-Asiri devised another device to put on a volunteer, this time a young Nigerian called Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
He was able to fly all the way from Europe to Detroit with a viable explosive device hidden in his underpants, a massive failure of intelligence and security.
But when he tried to light it as the plane approached Detroit airport, he was spotted, overpowered, arrested and convicted of the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction.
As Western intelligence heads scrambled to assess this new development, the British government decided to raise the UK national terror threat level to ""critical"", its highest ever. (It has since dropped back down to ""substantial"", the third highest of five.)
The next year, 2010, AQAP tried again, smuggling bombs onto the cargo holds of planes hidden inside printer ink toner cartridges.
The intended destination was America and one device got as far as the UK's East Midlands airport. The plot was thwarted at the last minute by a tip-off from a Saudi informer inside AQAP, but the group has promised to keep trying.
Since then AQAP's leaders have come under continual attack from unmanned US Reaper drones or UAVs, losing several top operatives, including their deputy leader, Saeed al-Shihri, and the influential English-speaking propagandists Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan.
According to the US think-tank the New America Foundation, US drone strikes in Yemen have soared, from 18 in 2011 to 53 in 2012.
A drone strike on Tuesday reportedly hit a car carrying four al-Qaeda operatives.
In Yemen, the US drones are deeply unpopular, sometimes hitting the wrong targets and wiping out whole extended families.
Human rights groups have branded them as a form of extra-judicial killing. Local tribes also view them as an insulting infringement of national sovereignty.
But US and Yemeni officials argue that in the wilder, more remote parts of the country, including Shabwa, Marib and Abyan provinces, targeting from the air based on tip-offs on the ground is their only means of stopping those plotting fresh attacks.","Whatever plot the US eavesdroppers overheard the top two al-Qaeda leaders discussing clearly rattled the US intelligence community so badly that Washington shut 19 of its diplomatic missions around the Middle East, Asia and Africa.",23593126

When Liverpool host Wolves in the FA Cup fourth round, it will be over two years since boyhood Reds fan Coady, now 23, was allowed to leave the club.
And he is intent only on helping his side become the third in a week to win at Anfield.
""We're going there to win and hopefully take the game to them,"" he told BBC WM.
Coady never got to play a home game in his three years at Anfield, with both his first-team appearances coming on the road, the second as a late sub for Philippe Coutinho in a 3-1 win at Fulham, his only one in the Premier League.
After a season-long loan with Sheffield United, he eventually moved on to Huddersfield Town in August 2014 and then Wolves a year later.
But Coady knows, from his experience watching the Reds as a boy, that Liverpool do not have many slumps of the current magnitude and Wolves might have timed their trip to Anfield just right.
""We've got a great chance the way Liverpool are playing,"" he said. ""They're a top team but they've had quite a lot of games.""
Since Wolves won 2-0 in the third round at Stoke on 7 January, Paul Lambert's men have only played twice, while Liverpool have been in action six times.
Of those six games, they have won only once - the FA Cup third-round replay at League Two side Plymouth - have failed to score in three of them and have lost their last two at home.
Following the shock home defeat by Swansea City which damaged their Premier League title hopes, Wednesday's League Cup semi-final exit to Southampton has cast a cloud over Anfield.
""We've got to take that into account,"" said Coady. ""We've got go there on the front foot, try to stop them playing, hopefully nick the ball and see if we can get something out of it.""
And what if Coady himself were to find the net? ""It would be what dreams are made of,"" he grinned. ""I'm not one of those who wouldn't celebrate. I'd go ballistic to score for this club. It doesn't happen very often.""
Wolves boss Lambert knows what it takes to win at Anfield. His Aston Villa side did so in December 2012, and Wolves loan signing Andreas Weimann was one of the Villa scorers that day in a 3-1 victory.
So can he do it again? Fourth in the Premier League v 18th in the Championship?
""We're up against an iconic club, and we're going to have to handle the atmosphere and the crowd, but I'd be disappointed if we couldn't handle the occasion,"" Lambert told BBC WM.
""If we can do that, we can win the game. And I believe in them. Mentally, they're ready for it. They'll handle it.""
Lambert is keenly awaiting his reunion with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who he first met when they did the Pro Licence coaching course together in Germany in 2004.
He was playing for Celtic by then, long after he had helped Borussia Dortmund win the European Cup in 1997 and four years before Klopp took over as Dortmund boss in 2008.
""He was also at a club I was fortunate to play for,"" said Lambert. ""There were connections between us and he went on to bring Dortmund back to where they should have been - two league titles, two cups and a kick away from winning the Champions League.

"They ruled that Attorney General John Larkin QC's bid came too late.
Mr Larkin sought to refer the verdict against Ashers bakery to the UK's highest court under devolution issues.
In October, the Appeal Court upheld a ruling against the bakery's Christian owners that their refusal to make a cake iced with the slogan ""Support Gay Marriage"" was discriminatory.
A long-running legal battle ensued when customer Gareth Lee sued after his order was declined at the company's Belfast city centre shop in May 2014.
The gay rights activist had requested a cake depicting Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie with the slogan for an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia.
Bakery bosses refunded his money for the order because the message went against their Christian faith.

"Ms Churcher, who was director of the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) from 1990 to 1997, was the first and so far only female director of the NGA.
She was known as Betty Blockbuster as a result of the large-scale exhibitions of famous European artworks she organised during her time at the NGA.
Before that, she was director of the Art Gallery of Western Australia.
She continued to promote Australian and international art to the public in later years, with a series of popular television programmes.
NGA director Gerard Vaughan described Ms Churcher as a ""towering figure in the Australian art community"".
""She will always be remembered here with deep affection for her tireless promotion of our visual culture, including her role as a popular presenter on TV, and I am reminded daily of her contribution to the nation,"" he said in a statement released by the gallery.
Ms Churcher was born in the Queensland city of Brisbane in 1931 and discovered art when her father took her to the Queensland Art Gallery as a child.
""It was like stepping on a magic carpet because off I went!"" she once said in an interview.
In recent years, declining eyesight made it increasingly difficult for her to look at the paintings she loved.
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation several years ago she said that when she realised she could no longer remember the paintings in the Prado and the National Gallery that she adored, she decided to tour the great galleries of Europe, sketch the masterpieces and commit their details to memory.
""The paintings that I most like are the ones that demand a second, and a third and a fourth look,"" she said.
""And each time you look, they've got something more to give you.
""I know that I could look at Velazquez's Maid of Honour until I died and I still couldn't get to the bottom of it, to find out how it was that he did it.""

"Dr Adesina said providing millions of farmers with seeds and fertilisers was vital to boost development.
He added that 98% of the world's 800 million undernourished people live in Africa.
Since 1986, the World Food Prize aims to recognise efforts to increase the quality and quantity of available food.
Dr Adesina told BBC News that he was ""very humbled"" to win the award.
""For me, the award is not just about recognition for me, it is also about putting the wind behind the sails of what still needs to be done in African agriculture,"" he said.
He added that the critical issue that needed to be addressed was that the level of productivity of the African agricultural sector was ""so, so low"".
""One of the things that I have worked on was how to accelerate our efforts,"" he observed.
""You know, you can find Coca-Cola or Pepsi anywhere in rural Africa, so why can't you find seeds or why can you not find fertilisers?
""It is because the model that was used to distribute those farm inputs were old models based on government distribution systems, which are very, very inefficient.
""So I thought the best way to do that is to support rural entrepreneurs to have their own small shops to sell seeds and fertilisers to farmers.
""We started these agro-dealer networks and they spread over Africa. It brought farm inputs closer to farmers and it encouraged the private sector into the rural space.""
The World Food Prize was founded in 1986 by Dr. Norman E Borlaug, recipient of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize.
Dr Adesina will receive the US $250,000 prize at the Borlaug Dialogue international symposium, which is held in the US to ""help further the discussion on cutting-edge global food security issues and inspire the next generation to end hunger"".
President of the World Food Prize Foundation, former US ambassador Kenneth Quinn, said the judging panel hoped awarding Dr Adesia this year's prize would help provide ""further impetus to his profound vision for enhancing nutrition, uplifting smallholder farmers, and inspiring the next generation of Africans as they confront the challenges of the 21st century"".
Considering what work still need to be done, Dr Adesina told BBC News: "" I am really somebody who came out of poverty myself, and poverty is not pretty.
""I know that in order to create opportunities for the several tens of millions of young people in rural Africa today we have to make agriculture a business.

Centre Sene Naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker Marlie Packer, and home captain Paula Fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of England players.
England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop Keates drove over the line from two metres out.
Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute Mairead Coyne made a deliberate knock-on.
Hooker Cokayne burst through to increase England's advantage but Ireland hooker Leah Lyons responded to give Ireland hope.

All four refused to consent to extradition when appearing in court.
The men are due to appear before magistrates again on 20 November.
They were arrested on Thursday on European Arrest warrants.
During their court appearance, their lawyers indicated they may challenge their extradition because of the risk of ""refoulement"", which the United Nations defines as ""the expulsion of persons who have the right to be recognised as refugees"".
The men were held as part of raids in six European countries, led by Italian authorities and connected to a suspected ""jihadist network"", Rawti Shax, which is said to be seeking to establish a caliphate in Iraq's Kurdistan region.
The group was allegedly plotting to free its leader, Mullah Krekar, who is in detention in Norway.
Suspects were also arrested in Italy and Norway, while authorities in Italy, Germany, Finland, Norway, Switzerland and the UK also searched a total of 26 properties.
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said there was no suggestion any of those arrested were planning attacks in the UK.
Their focus appeared to have been in the Middle East, he added, with the investigation aimed at breaking up an international recruiting pipeline that was sending jihadists to join the Islamic State and Al-Nusra organisations - both proscribed terrorist organisations - in Iraq and Syria.
Eurojust, the EU agency which co-ordinated the European raids, said suspected leaders and several members of the group were arrested during simultaneous activity in the six countries.
It added: ""The arrested persons are charged with international terrorism.""
The operation, which follows several years of work by investigators, was launched under the direction of the Public Prosecution Office in Rome.
Mullah Krekar went to Norway as a refugee in 1991 from Iraq and founded radical Islamist group Ansar al-Islam, although he later tried to distance himself from it.
Norwegian authorities have been trying to deport him since 2003 after deeming him a threat to national security.
Eurojust said Rawti Shax, or Didi Nwe, meaning the ""new course"" or ""towards the mountain"", represented an ""evolution of Ansar al-Islam"", which is listed by the UN as a terrorist organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda.
It says the group has a ""primary objective"" which is to ""violently overthrow the current Iraqi Kurdish government and replace it with a caliphate governed by Sharia law"".
It also alleged that the group was active in providing logistical and financial support for the recruitment of foreign fighters to be sent to Syria and Iraq, and also had the intent of training them for a future conflict in Kurdistan.",Four men arrested in the UK following an international counter-terrorism operation have appeared in court to face extradition proceedings to Italy.,34806028

"The Italian's first season in charge, following an appointment greeted with a wave of indifference, ended with a success that defied history, logic, the odds and the game's natural financial order, as he turned a Leicester team that narrowly avoided relegation into champions.
The day Ranieri, in a stadium cloaked dramatically in storm clouds but fuelled by undiluted emotion, led blind tenor Andrea Bocelli to the centre circle to start the title celebrations seemed an age away as Leicester brutally sacked the man who gave the club its greatest moment.
So how has football's greatest fairytale descended into a nightmare in just nine months?
It is almost the thought that dare not speak its name amid the wave of shock, outrage and disgust at Leicester's decision to ruthlessly dismiss the hugely popular 65-year-old, who won the hearts of all supporters with his good humour, class and dignity as he led the Foxes to the title.

Lineker echoed the thoughts of the majority who aired their views publicly - but is there actually method in what many see at the madness of the club's Thai owners?
Leicester's fall has been more dramatic than anything they could have foreseen in their worst nightmares. A win for any of Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Hull City this weekend would put the Foxes in the relegation places. Wins for all three and they would be bottom by the time they face Liverpool on what will now be a highly charged occasion at the King Power on Monday.
After 26 games last year they were top on 53 points, two ahead of Spurs. This season they are 17th after 25 games, with only 21 points. Last season they had lost only three games compared with 14 in this campaign, and conceded only 29 goals compared with 43 this term. Indeed, they only conceded 36 in the entire 2015-16 season.
The difference is stark and, very clearly in the opinion of Leicester's owners, dangerous.
The clear and present danger was the threat of relegation, as stated by vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha when he said: ""It was never our expectation that the extraordinary feats of last season should be replicated this season. Survival in the Premier League was our first and only target at the start of the campaign.""
Would Leicester fans have thanked the board for being sentimental all the way into the Championship? Cut away the romance, sentimentality and the memories of last season and they will feel this decision has been taken to stave off the most dramatic fall of any Premier League champions.
It will still, however, be a very hard sell given Ranieri's history-making effort last season.
No manager can ever be unsackable - but Ranieri's reserve of credit was as close to limitless as it gets after performing a sporting miracle to win the title last season.
It is the second season in succession a Premier League-winning manager has failed to survive the following campaign. Jose Mourinho was sacked by Chelsea after he was a champion in 2015.
Mourinho, however, was at a club with a high turnover of managers that had enjoyed huge successes - he had not pulled perennial strugglers from near the bottom to top of the table in the blink of an eye.
Plenty will regard Leicester's treatment of Ranieri as a cut-throat act from an ownership who should wake up and give him thanks every day for giving them a success and a story they would have regarded as fantasy when they appointed him.
Ranieri took Leicester from 14th to first with a style built on solid defence, fierce organisation and a thrilling counter-attacking style based around Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. He was the master man-manager, taking all the pressure and letting his players fly.
There is no doubt there is some real unease among Leicester's fans about Ranieri's sacking, and how it reflects on the image of the club supported so fervently by neutrals - and just about any club that could not win the title - last season. Leicester were having relegation wished on them on social media on Thursday by those whose hearts they won last year.
The manner in which Ranieri has been shown off the premises has prompted questions about basic loyalty and decency in football, and how a manager who made Leicester a worldwide feelgood sports story can be treated in such a way.
And surely his success last season proved he could still keep Leicester in the Premier League?
Ranieri is experienced, up for the fight and had a reservoir of goodwill last season to call on.
Sadly for this most amiable and classy of men, the reservoir ran dry on Thursday.
The vote of confidence is always regarded as 'dreaded' - but Leicester's for Ranieri may come to be known as notorious.
It was on 7 February, 16 days before the axe fell, and after a 3-0 home defeat by Manchester United, that they announced ""unwavering support"" for the Italian, stressing boardroom loyalty further by adding ""the unprecedented success achieved in recent seasons has been based firmly on stability, togetherness and determination to overcome even the greatest of challenges"".
So what has happened since to effect such a change?
Leicester beat Derby in an FA Cup fourth-round replay the following day but then turned in a dreadful display to lose 2-0 at relegation rivals Swansea before going out of the FA Cup with an under-strength team at League One Millwall.
A Champions League last-16 loss at La Liga powerhouses Sevilla was a relatively acceptable result but the performance was poor - were Leicester's owners simply seeing no signs of improvement?
Grim reality, not to mention fear, may also have descended on the boardroom at the sight of Hull City showing progress under Marco Silva as the club felt the cold hand of relegation on its shoulder.
What is clear is something has changed dramatically, and it is the ominous prospect of going from champions to Championship in 12 months.
Leicester's players would have done well to avoid social media after news emerged of Ranieri's sacking. There was widespread sympathy for the manager and scathing criticism for the players whose standards have fallen through the floor.
Something has been amiss from day one this season after a summer of big new contracts for the title winners and one very crucial departure.
Jamie Vardy, top scorer with 24 goals last season, rejected a £22m summer move to Arsenal to sign a lucrative new four-year deal. The Gunners may regard this as a bullet dodged as he has scored only five league goals this season, including a hat-trick in the 4-2 win against Manchester City.
PFA Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez, coveted across Europe, signed a four-year contract, while goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, wanted by Everton, signed a five-year deal along with midfielder Danny Drinkwater.
Mahrez scored 17 league goals last season but has contributed only three this term, while Drinkwater has failed to reproduce the form that earned him an England call-up.
Leicester's players appear to have lost the hunger, as well as the element of surprise, that enabled them to climb the mountain last season.
And in some cases, such as captain Wes Morgan and Robert Huth, they have simply reverted to the workaday Premier League central defenders they were before they were carried along with an unstoppable momentum last season.
There has also been sniping behind the scenes that has not helped Ranieri, with whispers emanating from inside the camp that he had become distant from his backroom staff amid growing unrest from his management team and players.
The same stories came out about Ranieri's tactical approach - giving the impression the players were happy to take the acclaim last season but were only too willing to point the finger of blame at their manager after it went wrong.
He was also subjected to a public attack from striker Leonardo Ulloa, who accused Ranieri of betrayal as a move to Sunderland was falling through.
If these players have been using Ranieri as a shield for their own shortcomings, then this has been removed. They now have no excuses or scapegoat.
And yet the biggest factor of all may be a player who is no longer at Leicester.
N'Golo Kante, Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year last season, took his relentless tackling, work-rate and guile to Chelsea in the summer in a £32m deal. The Foxes have never been the same - whereas he is on course for another title at Stamford Bridge.
Once the shockwaves have subsided, Ranieri will be remembered as the manager who gave Leicester, the city and the football club, its greatest sporting moment. He made Leicester a worldwide good news story.
He will be remembered as a man of manners and dignity but with a steel behind the smile that enabled him to lead the Foxes to perhaps the most unlikely triumph in British sport.
Ranieri will also be remembered by many as someone who was treated shabbily and without gratitude at the end - an example of how sentiment will never exist in football.
In the final analysis, though, he will remembered at Leicester as a good man who performed a great feat. And will be remembered forever.
It must be assumed Leicester's owners have a new man in mind to make such a seismic move as sacking Ranieri.
Combustible former manager Nigel Pearson was even linked with a return, but one live contender appears to be Ranieri's compatriot Roberto Mancini.
He is available, had a short spell as a Leicester player in 2001 and has Premier League experience as a manager. Mancini led Manchester City from December 2009 to May 2013, winning the FA Cup in 2011 and their first title in 44 years 12 months later.

Q&A: Stand-off in Ukraine
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is due to meet Mr Putin on Friday in Sochi, on the opening day of the Winter Olympic Games there.
He held talks in Kiev with US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland on Thursday, at which he said he favoured dialogue and compromise with the opposition.
Meanwhile, an audio recording has been posted online, which is purported to be a hacked phone conversation between Ms Nuland and US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt, in which the female speaker dismisses EU efforts to resolve the crisis, using an expletive.
The two speakers also discuss frankly the merits of the three main Ukrainian opposition leaders in the conversation. The US embassy declined to comment on the tape.
Thousands of Ukrainian opposition activists, some carrying shields and baseball bats, marched from their camp on Independence Square in the capital Kiev to parliament in a show of force on Thursday.
They came close to government supporters who are camped next to parliament behind barricades manned by hundreds of police, but the march passed off peacefully.
In another development, a man received a serious hand injury when he reportedly opened a letter bomb inside one of the buildings occupied by protesters in Kiev, Trade Union House. He was rushed to hospital, police confirmed.
Mr Glazyev told Kommersant newspaper's Ukrainian edition: ""According to this document [the memorandum], Russia and the US are guarantors of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and, frankly speaking, they are obliged to intervene when conflict situations of this kind arise.""
The memorandum, which also involved the UK, was signed after Ukraine gave up its claim to any part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal after the dissolution of the USSR.
Mr Glazyev, who is widely regarded as Mr Putin's chief adviser on Ukraine, gave a wide-ranging interview to Kommersant.
He warned that if the opposition did not end its occupation of Independence Square, which is now into its fourth month, President Yanukovych might have no choice but to use force.
""In a situation when the authorities encounter a coup attempt, they simply have no choice [but to use force],"" he said. ""Otherwise the country will be plunged into chaos.""
Accusing the Americans of ""interfering flagrantly and unilaterally in the internal affairs of Ukraine"", he said: ""There is information that within the grounds of the American embassy, there is training for fighters, that they're arming them.""
Mr Glazyev predicted the situation there would ""normalise"" if the US desisted from intervening.
Russia itself has been widely accused of intervening in Ukraine, using its economic clout to persuade President Yanukovych and his allies to abandon closer ties with the EU in favour of Russia and other ex-Soviet states.
The current stand-off in the streets began in November after President Yanukovych refused to sign a far-reaching agreement with Brussels at the last moment.
It descended into violence last month after a new law to curb protests - which has since been repealed - provoked fury among the opposition.
At least three protesters died in the violence, as did at least three police officers, and hundreds of people were injured.
The opposition accuses the security forces of abducting and torturing activists.
One of these, Dmytro Bulatov, who has been receiving medical treatment in Lithuania, told reporters on Thursday he had been beaten, choked and interrogated in an ordeal lasting eight days.
""I was telling them lies just to stop the torture,"" said Mr Bulatov, 35. ""At one point I asked them to kill me because I couldn't stand it anymore.""","A senior adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the US of meddling in Ukraine, in breach of a 1994 agreement over non-intervention.",26068994
"If found guilty on the charge of negligence, she could be jailed for up to 10 years.
The anti-corruption agency has also called for her to be personally liable for losses to state coffers.
Ms Yingluck was removed by a court in May 2014, shortly before the military ousted her elected government.
She was later impeached over the rice subsidy scheme and banned from politics for five years. Thailand, meanwhile, remains under martial law in the wake of the coup.
Ms Yingluck was not at Bangkok's Supreme Court to hear the indictment.
But the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says today's court filing will seem to her supporters like yet another attempt by the military to crush her politically for whenever Thailand does return to democratic rule.
Under the rice subsidy scheme Ms Yingluck's Pheu Thai-led government bought rice from Thai farmers at above the market rate, costing the government billions of dollars.
Critics accused Ms Yingluck of funnelling money to her core supporters. She said the policy was aimed at helping farmers and denied any day-to-day involvement in the running of the scheme.
The Supreme Court will decide on 19 March whether to pursue the criminal case.
Additionally, Finance Minister Sommai Phasee said on Wednesday that the ministry had received a letter from the national corruption watchdog urging it to pursue civil suit against Ms Yingluck to recover losses of 600bn baht ($18.4bn; Â£11.9bn) related to the scheme.
""The finance ministry oversees damages to the state and is ready to take action,"" he said.
The military seized power in May 2014 in what it said was a bid to restore public order after months of occasionally violent street protests against Ms Yingluck's government.
But Thailand has been embroiled in a cycle of political instability since the military ousted Ms Yingluck's brother, billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister in 2006.
The Shinawatra family are hugely popular among Thailand's rural population but are hated by the urban middle-class and elite who accuse them of corruption.

"This week's edition of the influential news magazine Der Spiegel is a beseeching entreaty in red, white and blue.
Covered in a union jack and printed in English and German, the publication is dedicated to the referendum debate.
Der Spiegel is unambiguously opposed to a Brexit: ""The only internationally known politician in favour of a Brexit,' its editors write, 'is Donald Trump - and, if nothing else does, that alone should make the British worry.""
The majority of Germans apparently agree; earlier this month a poll revealed 79% don't want Britain to leave the EU.
For months many here have been bemused, perplexed and downright concerned by the notion that Britain might want to leave.
The Germans hoping Britain stays in the EU
Germany conflicted on how to handle Brexit
German power is the real key to Europe
EU referendum: All you need to know
EU referendum issues guide
In the words of one of Angela Merkel's senior conservatives: ""David Cameron is like the sorcerer's apprentice. He doesn't know what he's started.""
But, with just over a week to referendum day, the German press are happy to lay bare their version of how it could finish.
A Brexit, Spiegel predicts, would be ""a threefold catastrophe: bad for Germany, bad for Britain and cataclysmic for Europe.""
The newspaper Die Zeit envisages a doomsday Brexit scenario. Panic at the London stock exchange, a scramble among Europe's leaders to maintain a united front, a party for Marine le Pen and independence for Scotland. Great Britain, the newspaper predicts, will be flying blind.
Europe is jittery. For the first time, yields on 10-year German government bonds have fallen below zero.
And the real possibility that Britain may vote leave has generated a palpable sense of alarm in Berlin.
Which explains Angela Merkel's recent intervention in the referendum debate.
She and her advisors have been wary of doing so; they are keenly aware that British voters and commentators could (and some did) interpret any public comment as interference. And they don't wish to unwittingly boost the Leave campaign.
Mrs Merkel's language was careful and muted. Her short statement carefully timed and co-ordinated with Downing Street. But it contained a stark warning; if Britain opts out, it will lose its bargaining power with the EU.
Her finance minister was less diplomatic. ""Out is out,"" said Wolfgang Schauble.
A Britain outside the EU could forget access to the single market, he said, ruling out the kind of trading relationship held by Norway or Switzerland.
""That won't work,"" he said. ""It would require the country to abide by the rules of a club from which it currently wants to withdraw.""
Far less well publicised was what a senior German CDU MP told Der Spiegel.
Juergen Hardt, the party's foreign policy spokesman, offered an intriguing glimpse into how Berlin may be preparing for Brexit.
If the UK votes to leave, Mr Hardt said, then the EU should gauge possible action to prevent a British exit from becoming a reality. Brussels shouldn't close the door right away.
One way or another, Germany wants to keep Britain close.
There are the obvious reasons; within Europe, Britain is a powerful economic and political ally for Germany. Without Britain, some here worry that Germany will be perceived as too big, too dominant within the union.
The two countries are important to each other commercially; the UK is Germany's fifth most important trading partner.
Take the car industry: last year Germany sold 810,000 cars to the UK - around a fifth of the total number it exports worldwide.
And German companies manufactured 216,000 cars in the UK, according to the head of the German car makers' association.
Matthias Wissman has repeatedly warned of the negative impact a Brexit would have on the entire industry.
And there is a wider concern in Berlin. As one senior MP put it: ""Brexit would be a catastrophic and disastrous message to the rest of the world that Europe doesn't work and can't stick together.""
As one commentator put it, part of the reason Angela Merkel supported David Cameron's efforts to renegotiate a relationship with the EU is that she does not want to go down in history as the German chancellor under whom Europe fell apart.
Angela Merkel makes no secret of her commitment to the European project.
The degree to which a Brexit might encourage other countries to follow suit is difficult to quantify.
But it is clear that populism and anti-EU sentiment are changing Europe's political landscape - fuelled in part by the refugee crisis.
Last month, a YouGov poll revealed that, in the event of a referendum here, nearly one in three Germans would vote to leave the EU.
That is surprising in a country where, it is often said, people identify as European first, German second.
There is a general election in Germany next year.
Angela Merkel has yet to announce whether she will stand but it's widely believed that she will.
Her Christian Democrats are likely to lose votes to the party Alternativ Fuer Deutschland.
It has positioned itself as anti-Islamic and wants more power for national governments within Europe.
There is a lot of stake for the Merkel administration.
But there is another force driving those who want Britain to stay.
As one commuter sitting in the sunshine outside Berlin's main railway station put it: ""Great Britain is doing what they think is best for them. I like the British, I like London. I'm sure the Brits will do the right thing.""
There is, among Germans, a genuine affection for Britain.
As those Spiegel editors write: ""Germany has always looked across the Channel with envyâ€¦ (Brits) have an inner independence that we Germans lack.""
That affection was perhaps most in evidence here last summer during the Queen's visit to Berlin (the British Royal Family is hugely popular here) when German television went into royal overdrive and crowds turned out to greet the British monarch.
During that visit, both the Queen and the German president appealed for European unity and made reference to World War Two through which they both lived.
""The European Union needs Britain,"" said Joachim Gauck.
""A united Europe, a strong European Union represents stability, peace and freedom for us all.""
It is a narrative which underpins discussions here because, fundamentally, for many Germans, that's still what the EU is all about.
At times there is frustration at the level of the debate in Britain. Boris Johnson's likening of the EU's aims to those of Hitler irritated many Germans.
And Iain Duncan Smith's claims that ""the Germans"" had, in effect, bullied David Cameron over his renegotiations infuriated the government.
There is an acceptance here that Britain's perspective on the EU has always been markedly different.
And there is a consensus that, without that perspective, Europe would be a poorer place.
""Obviously, it is up to the citizens of the UK themselves how they wish to vote in the upcoming referendum. I've said repeatedly before that I personally would hope and wish for the UK to stay part and parcel of the EU.""
""We work well together with the UK particularly when we talk about new rules for the EU. We have to develop those together with the UK and whenever we negotiate that, you can much better have an influence on the debate when you sit at the bargaining table and you can give input to those negotiations and the result will then invariably be better rather than being outside of the room.""
""It would not only be in our interest but it could also be in the interest of Britain when it can bring its whole political weight to the negotiating table as part and parcel of the EU."" (Speaking at joint news conference with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Berlin, 2 June).","""Please don't go!""",36526839

"The stormy weather made for treacherous racing on slippery roads but Team Sky's Froome survived the final descent into Morzine to maintain his overall lead.
Froome's lead over Romain Bardet of four minutes five seconds will not be tested on the final stage in Paris.
Stage 20 was won by Spanish Movistar rider Jon Izaguirre.
He rode clear of fellow breakaway riders Jarlinson Pantano of the IAM Cycling team and 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali to win the 146km stage in four hours, six minutes and 45 seconds.
Froome, who crashed on a rainy descent on Friday, was more cautious on Saturday's drop into Morzine and finished more than four minutes behind Izaguirre but only a few seconds adrift of his rivals in the overall standings.
""I still need to get the yellow jersey to Paris tomorrow but certainly the racing side is done and dusted,"" said Froome, who won the 2013 and 2015 editions of the three-week race.
""It's an amazing feeling of relief, just coming over the last line today. Thank you to all my team-mates, they've really been there for me every step of the way and I couldn't ask for more.""
Frenchman Bardet finished six seconds ahead of Froome to cement second place, while Quintana, who said he ""suffered from allergies"" during the race, will finish third.
Tradition dictates that the man in the race leader's yellow jersey is not challenged during Sunday's largely processional final stage in Paris which is expected to end in a bunch sprint.
The 113km route from Chantilly will start in pedestrian fashion with Froome posing for photographs with his team-mates, sipping the obligatory glass of champagne.
The stage finishes with nine laps around the centre of Paris and Froome still has to race on the cobbles of the Champs-Elysees and make it across the finish line to be crowned champion for a third time.
In doing so, he will become just the eighth rider to win three Tour titles, following legendary five-time winners Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, while joining Philippe Thys, Louison Bobet and Greg LeMond who have all won three.
Froome is also set to become the first man since Indurain, who won his five titles consecutively from 1991, to successfully defend the title.
Tour director Christian Prudhomme said it was Froome's incredible attacks on stages eight and 11 that were the stand-out moments for him.
""There was no surprise because Chris Froome won. But for me it was not the same as in previous years,"" he said.
""When he attacked in the Peyrsourde descent it was such a surprise. And he did it again when he went with Peter Sagan in Montpellier. I liked it very much. Chris Froome was very good, his opponents less good.""
Britain's Adam Yates will finish a terrific fourth overall and in possession of the white jersey as the best rider under the age of 25.
The 23-year-old from Bury was second from stages seven to 12, and only lost third place to Nairo Quintana, one of the pre-race favourites, on Friday's penultimate stage in the mountains.
However, his initial nine-second deficit became 19 when he was penalised 10 seconds for receiving a push from an Orica BikeExchange team-mate. That gap was extended to 21 seconds as he finished Saturday's stage behind Quintana.
Yates' consolation was retaining the white jersey, which he won by two minutes and 16 seconds ahead of South Africa's Louis Meintjes.
Froome knew only too well how easily a slip could have cost him dearly on the wet descents in this undulating stage, with his right knee bandaged from a fall in similar conditions on the previous day.
He had also suffered road rash on his back and, with the road damp and the downhill finish looking dangerous, he was mindful to stay safely around his team-mates.
Geraint Thomas, who handed over his bike to Froome on Friday to let his team leader complete the stage, did the job of guiding the yellow jersey up and over Col de Joux Plane, the final mountain of this year's Tour.
All of the general classification front runners remained in the peloton with Froome, and the pace was only increased when Roman Kreuziger had leapt from 12th to second overall, causing slight concern among the podium contenders.
In the end, Czech Kreuziger was unable to maintain the pace and a large breakaway was whittled down to the pairing of Jarlinson Pantano and Julian Alaphilippe, who were soon joined and passed by 2014 champion Vincenzo Nibali.
Nibali, a favourite to win road race gold at the Olympics next month, was caught by Pantano and a resurgent Izaguirre, and the Basque-born rider descended impeccably to claim his first Tour de France stage win and Movistar's first of this year's Tour.
""I think my parents must have been scared watching at home,"" he said. ""I wanted to drop Nibali because I was worried about him in a sprint. Beating Nibali in a downhill is something that counts in a career.""

""For now the most important thing is our pre-season and getting through the tour, training and getting fitness,"" added Ozil, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid for £42.4m in 2013.
""I have always said that I feel very good at Arsenal.""
While Ozil appears keen to stay, the futures of Chile forward Alexis Sanchez and France striker Olivier Giroud remain less clear.
Giroud, 30, has been with Arsenal for five years but has been linked with moves to Premier League rivals Everton and West Ham.
""I've been through some difficulty this last year, but always succeed to bounce back,"" said the former Montpellier forward.
""I'm still an Arsenal player and try to be professional like I always have done and to prepare well for the next season.""

"They own the boundary wall along the River Arun at Arundel, West Sussex, which gave way in January after high tides and heavy rainfall.
But their insurers have refused to pay for repairs and the Environment Agency said it is the owners' responsibility.
Local MP Nick Herbert described it as a ""deeply unsatisfactory situation"".
Johnny Boylan, who is one of three affected homeowners, said the wall collapsed eight months after he and his partner moved into their house on River Road.
He said they repaired the top section of the wall when they moved in but had not realised at the time they owned the full wall down to the river bed.
""There is no mention of the river wall in our deeds,"" he said.
""It's an ancient part of the wall and now our insurance company is saying we are not insured because it was neglected.""
Mr Boylan and his partner are currently unable to live in the property.
""It's a deeply unsatisfactory situation,"" Mr Herbert, MP for Arundel and South Downs, said.
""The Environment Agency and the public authorities are saying this is the householders' responsibility.
""That would be fine except that the insurers are saying this is the Environment Agency's responsibility.""
He added the ""poor policyholders"" were now in a position where they may have to meet the bill ""of several hundred thousand pounds"".

""When you come off the back of a six or seven-hour journey and you concede a goal after five minutes it's always going to be tough.""
Barrow extended their unbeaten league run to nine games with the victory, and although Braintree's losing run extended to three games, Cowley remained positive.

"The largest amount, of more than £100,000, was awarded to the Grade I-listed St Michael's Church in Munslow, to fund work to its roof and stonework.
All of the churches are part of the Diocese of Hereford.
The diocese said about £200,000 still needed to be raised to complete repairs at the churches.
It said grants were vital with the cost of expensive heritage restoration projects often falling on small congregations.
Anson Crouch, who helped put a bid together for St Michael's Church in Munslow, said the church still needed to find £30,000 to complete its repairs.
""It is quite a challenge for a little parish like this. The population is less than 400,"" he said.
""Initially we want to make the church weatherproof and then we'll start to look on the inside.""
The five Shropshire and three Herefordshire churches are all listed buildings, with many dating back to the 12th Century.
St Tysilio, in Sellack, will receive £75,000 towards structural work on its spire and tower, as well as repairs to stonework and some windows.
A £93,000 grant to St George's church in Milson is expected to help fund stabilisation work to walls, as well as re-roofing the chancel.

"The magnitude-7.3 quake hit at a depth of 10km (six miles) at 01:25 on Saturday (15:25 GMT on Friday) in Kyushu region. At least three people died and hundreds were injured.
A village has been evacuated after a dam collapsed, media reports say.
A tsunami warning was issued, and lifted some 50 minutes later.
Japan is regularly hit by earthquakes but stringent building codes mean that they rarely cause significant damage.
This new earthquake in Kyushu was much bigger and hit a wider area than the one that struck Kumamoto on Thursday night, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo.
In one town near the coast, the city hall has been so badly damaged there are fears it could collapse. A hospital has been evacuated because it is no longer safe.
Thousands of people have fled on to the streets and into parks - where they are huddled under blankets looking dazed and afraid, our correspondent says.
But there are numerous reports of people trapped inside buildings, including at least 60 inside an old people's home.
Public broadcaster NHK says the dam collapsed in the Nishihara village.
Television pictures showed thousands of people filling streets and parks, looking dazed across the region.
NHK had warned of sea waves of up to 1m (3ft).
Japan's nuclear authority said the Sendai nuclear plant was not damaged.
The quake was originally assessed as magnitude 7.1 but revised upwards to 7.3 later.
Gavin Hayes, a research geophysicist with the US Geological Survey (USGS) in Colorado, told the BBC that the latest earthquake would hamper the earlier rescue operation that was already under way.
He said more damage could be expected as the earthquake had been shallower and the fault-line had been much longer.
""The ground surface would have moved in the region of 4-5m. So, you are talking very intense shaking over quite a large area. And that's why we'll probably see a significant impact from this event.""
The Associated Press news agency said guests at the Ark Hotel near the Kumamoto Castle, which was damaged, woke up and gathered in the lobby for safety.
Thursday's magnitude-6.2 quake caused shaking at some places as intense as the huge earthquake that hit the country in 2011, Japan's seismology office said.
That quake sparked a huge tsunami and nuclear meltdown at a power plant in Fukushima.
Most of those who died in Thursday's quake were in the town of Mashiki where an apartment building collapsed and many houses were damaged.
More than 1,000 people were injured.
Some 40,000 people had initially fled their homes, with many of those closest to the epicentre spending the night outside, as more than 130 aftershocks had hit the area.
Japan is one of the most seismically active areas on Earth, accounting for about 20% of global quakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater. Seismometers are recording some kind of event every five minutes, on average.
It is through bitter experience that Japan has learnt the strategies to mitigate damage, injury and death. Not only does it implement some the best building construction practices but it has also established an early warning network.
This system relies on the lightning analysis of the developing quake, establishing its location and strength. Alerts are then broadcast that can give people more distant from the epicentre vital seconds' notice.
Just 10 seconds is more than sufficient to drop and get under a sturdy table or open the doors of a fire station.
The prospect of buildings already damaged in Thursday's quake toppling over in this latest tremor will be a concern.","A more powerful earthquake has rocked the southern Japanese city of Kumamoto in the middle of the night, a day after an earlier tremor killed nine people.",36059487
"The lawsuit filed in a federal court in San Francisco argues that the policy is unconstitutional.
Women can serve in front line positions in the US military, but they are barred from ground combat units.
A Pentagon spokesman said 14,500 combat positions had been opened to women under the current defence secretary.
He added that Defence Secretary Leon Panetta had ""directed the services to explore the possibility of opening additional roles for women in the military"".
But ACLU lawyer Ariela Migdal said the changes so far were ""not enough"". The lawsuit argues that continuing restrictions violate servicewomen's constitutional rights to equality.
One of the plaintiffs, Marine Corps Capt Zoe Bedell, said existing rules had blocked her advancement in the Marines.
""The military is the last place where you are allowed to be discriminated against because of your gender,"" she said.

"Pavey, a mother of two who only gave birth to her younger child Emily 11 months ago, ran the perfect tactical race to match the gold won by her old friend Paula Radcliffe in Munich 12 years ago.
When France's Clemence Calvin - 16 years her junior and almost 20 seconds faster this season - went to the front with two laps to go Pavey tucked in behind.
Then, at the bell, the Briton surged into the lead, held Calvin at bay on the back straight and kicked hard again as she came off the top bend to race to her first ever major title.
She becomes the oldest female gold medallist in the championships' history, and having won Commonwealth 5,000m bronze 10 days ago seals a wonderful summer at an age when most athletes are long retired.
Pavey told BBC Sport: ""I just can't believe it. I was finding it quite a long way - I was thinking, is this the right event?
""I'm really thrilled. I tried to do a controlled last lap, but when I got to the home straight I thought, just give it all you've got, so you don't regret anything.""
The time - 32 minutes 22.39 seconds - was irrelevant, Calvin hanging on for silver and her compatriot Laila Traby taking bronze.
British team captain Goldie Sayers had given a speech on the eve of the championships asking her team-mates a simple question: ""How would you perform if this was the last time you would ever compete?""
Her room-mate Pavey gave the best possible answer.
The Exeter Harrier has been running for her country for so long that she made her debut in a British vest in the same year her team-mate Morgan Lake was born.
Across four Olympic Games she has secured three top ten places, but this was a glorious finale that few could have predicted.
And on her lap of honour she ran to Emily and four-year-old son Jacob before embracing husband and coach Gavin and her own parents.
Earlier, all three of the British men made it safely through to Wednesday's semi-finals of the 100m, Dwain Chambers winning the second heat in 10.18 secs and James Dasaolu the third, easing up in 10.22 secs, before Harry Aikines-Aryeetey took his in 10.19 secs.
But France's Jimmy Vicaut, the only man in the field to run under 10 seconds this summer, looks the man to beat after an impressive 10.06 secs - the joint third fastest time in the championships' long history.
World champion Christine Ohuruogu also appears to be coming into some form at the right time, winning her 400m heat in 51.40 secs, while Tiffany Porter is into the 100m hurdles final as the fastest qualifier.
But there was disappointment for Britain's two 800m men, Andrew Osagie and Michael Rimmer, who failed to get through to the semi-finals, 28 years after the famous night when Sebastian Coe, Tom McKean and Steve Cram won European gold, silver and bronze for a British clean sweep.","Forty-year-old Jo Pavey became the oldest woman ever to claim gold at a European Championships when she won a thrilling 10,000m and got Team GB's campaign in Zurich off to the perfect start.",28765536
"The track's release date was brought forward by five weeks after a cover version by X Factor's Fleur East topped the iTunes chart last week.
Ronson thanked ""boy wonder"" Bruno Mars, who features on the track, ""without whom there would be no jam"".
Ed Sheeran, who scores a 10th week at the top of the album charts, fell to number two in the singles chart, while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three.
The physical release of Do They Know It's Christmas? saw the charity track climb nine places, but it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran.
East, who is the favourite to win this year's X Factor, performed the Ronson track during the show's semi-final on Saturday 6 December.
Her mentor Cowell, who chose the track after Ronson and Mars pulled out of performing the song themselves on the talent show, called it ""one of the top three performances"" in X Factor history.
East later apologised to Ronson, calling it ""an amazing song"". ""I don't think anyone expected my performance to be as popular as it was,"" she added.
Speaking to the Official Charts company, Ronson refrained from mentioning East, but thanked ""everyone who bought, downloaded or DJ'd Uptown Funk this past week.""

The names will be announced during the One Show on BBC One between 19:00 and 19:30 GMT.
A capacity crowd of about 12,000 will attend the show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on Sunday, 15 December.
The programme will follow on from last year's awards where Sir Bradley Wiggins was crowned 2012 Sports Personality.
Full roll of honour
After Tuesday's announcement, there will be details of all the contenders and arrangements for public voting on the night at www.bbc.co.uk/sportspersonality.
Tour de France winner and Olympic road cycling champion Wiggins was the latest to join an illustrious roll of honour last year when he received the coveted trophy from the Duchess of Cambridge and former England football captain David Beckham, watched on television by more than 15m people.
Presenter Gary Lineker said: ""It's going to be tough to follow last year, the most unbelievable sporting year in living memory, but the fact that it is the 60th anniversary, the fact that it is coming to Leeds, means it's still going to be a huge show.""
Director of BBC Sport Barbara Slater added: ""We're thrilled Leeds is to host BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2013. The sporting heritage of the city is outstanding and the new arena will be a great venue from which to celebrate the very best of sport.""
Devised by Sir Paul Fox in 1954, the first Sports Personality of the Year was held at the Savoy Hotel in London, where it was presented by Peter Dimmock. World record-breaking 5,000m runner Sir Christopher Chataway beat four minute-mile hero Sir Roger Bannister to the award that year as the public voted for the first winner.
The trophy has since been won by many of the greats of British sport, including Bobby Moore, Princess Anne, Lord Coe, Daley Thompson, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, Sir Steve Redgrave, David Beckham, Dame Kelly Homes, Andrew Flintoff, Sir Chris Hoy and many more.

"Almost one million people have been evacuated from coastal areas in anticipation of a typhoon carrying wind speeds of 173km/h (107mph). Some 100mm of rain has fallen since Friday.
Chan-hom is now heading north past the city of Shanghai.
The typhoon hit Taiwan and Japan earlier in the week, uprooting trees and injuring several people.
Chan-hom first hit Zhejiang province on an island near the city of Ningbo at around 16:40 (08:40 GMT), the National Meteorological Center said.
No deaths or injuries were reported in the region by Saturday evening, state news agency Xinhua said.
One village, Laiao, received more than 400mm (16in) of rain, it said.
The BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai says more than 400 flights have been cancelled there along with a number of public events, and the government has told people they should stay at home.
Dozens of flights were also cancelled in Zhoushan, Hangzhou, Ningbo and Wenzhou.
Zhejiang province has called its entire fishing fleet back to port.
Some 100 train services were also cancelled.

"At low doses, lithium prolonged the life of fruit flies in lab experiments.
Scientists say the finding is ""encouraging"" and could eventually lead to new drugs to help people live longer and healthier lives.
Lithium is used in psychiatry to help stop mood swings but has a risk of serious side-effects at high doses.
How lithium acts on the brain is not fully understood, but in fruit flies the drug seems to extend life by blocking a chemical known as GSK-3.
""The response we've seen in flies to low doses of lithium is very encouraging and our next step is to look at targeting GSK-3 in more complex animals with the aim of eventually developing a drug regime to test in humans,"" said Prof Linda Partridge of the UCL Institute of Healthy Ageing, who led the study.
The research, published in Cell Reports, found fruit flies lived 16% longer than average when given low doses of lithium.
At high doses, lithium reduced their lifespan.
""We found low doses not only prolong life but also shield the body from stress and block fat production for flies on a high sugar diet,"" said co-researcher Dr Ivana Bjedov from the UCL Cancer Institute.
Claire Bale of the charity Parkinson's UK, which part-funded the study, said: ""It's encouraging to see that the researchers have been able to identify a key piece of the ageing puzzle, which one day may allow us to intervene in the ageing process.""
""This research has the potential to not only help create a healthier older generation, but also provide significant insights into how we could potentially treat or even prevent conditions of ageing like Parkinson's.""
Lithium salts have been used in the past as a health tonic and to heal conditions such as gout and migraines.

First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park.
England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan.
But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales.
France, so poor in their pool matches, were a side transformed as they took revenge for their World Cup defeats of 2007 and 2003.
""England were blown away in the first half and probably got a proper telling off. They came out with a little more pace and precision but they made too many mistakes with knock-ons, penalites and turnovers. England were never going to score from 80m out.
""Those who have watched England before could see they were not any different but whereas Scotland and Argentina couldn't last the distance and England won late on, France were a different outfit.""
The defeat will leave manager Martin Johnson under pressure after his gamble of pairing Jonny Wilkinson and Toby Flood at 10 and 12 failed to ignite the England back line, while his forwards were repeatedly second best at the set-piece and in the loose.
Johnson's contract expires in November, and four weeks as memorable for scandals off the pitch as any achievements on it will do little to appease the notoriously twitchy committee-men at the Rugby Football Union.
France were supposedly a team in pieces, beaten by Tonga just a week ago and with coach Marc Lievremont publicly berating his players, but so clear-cut was their victory that much of the atmosphere had been sucked from the contest long before the end.
England had an early opportunity with a line-out deep in French territory after a clever grubber from Foden only for Lionel Nallet to burgle back possession, and they then tore into France again as Alexis Palisson was smashed backwards after taking a garryowen and Manu Tuilagi thundered into Morgan Parra.
After spluttering sporadically for four games, England's Kiwi campaign ended as it probably deserved to: in defeat, to a team that was more dynamic, more clinical and far more composed when it mattered most.

But it was the most fleeting of false dawns. Dmitri Yachvilli slotted a penalty from distance after Flood failed to release his man on the deck, and France took a grip they would never relinquish.
Wilkinson was struggling, sending the re-start straight into touch and flinging a pass the same way, and France then went close to the first try of the contest as Clerc took a long pass out on the left and was just bundled into touch by the corner flag.
Yachvilli made it 6-0 with a second sweet strike from 45 metres after Matt Stevens was penalised for collapsing a scrum, and then slid another penalty just wide from the same spot.
England's players had talked of ""blitzing"" France in the first 20 minutes, but it was Lievremont's men with all the menace and danger.
Another line-out was stolen, and when the ball was sent left Clerc stepped and spun through limp challenges from Wilkinson, Chris Ashton and Foden to dive over and make it 11-0.
England were once again static in their few attacks, only Tuilagi's bullocking runs offering any threat, Flood reduced to aiming a long-range drop-goal pit which missed by a street.
Louis Deacon shipped another sloppy penalty, allowing Yachvili to kick to the corner, and after thunderous drives from the forwards left wing Alexis Palisson and Medard combined out wide to put the full-back in for France's second try.
England were in disarray, only Yachvili's failures with the conversions keeping them in the game, and when they finally created space for their wingers Cueto was dragged down metres from the line before another wayward pass from Wilkinson shut the door on Ashton wide out right.
England had never before come back to win from a margin of more than 12 points, and the errors continued to come thick and fast as Tom Croft became the latest to cough up the ball.
They grabbed an unlikely lifeline when Ben Youngs took a quick tap and go to release Foden, who jinked and dummied his way over to make it 16-5 with 23 minutes left on the clock, Wilkinson popping over the conversion for 16-7.
Johnson threw on his replacements but England kept wasting what good field possession they could work.
Flood popped out a careless off-load deep in the French 22 to allow a clearing kick to snuff out the danger, and when Nick Easter tried to rumble from deep within his own 22 his hospital pass to Tuilagi triggered another knock-on.
France, led by man-of-the-match Imanol Harinordoquy, set up camp in front of the English posts, and when the ball was fed back to Trinh-Duc the replacement fly-half slotted the drop-goal to make it 19-7.
Banahan's late charge allowed Cueto to touch down for a try at the death, but with Flood's conversion sliding wide England needed a converted try to force extra time - something they could neither conjure nor say their performance deserved.

"The Queensferry Crossing was scheduled to be completed by December this year but that deadline will not be met.
Keith Brown, the cabinet secretary for the economy, said the delay had been caused by ""adverse weather conditions"" in April and May.
In a statement to MSPs he said the delay was a ""very recent development"" caused by high winds earlier this year.
Mr Brown said the contractor, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC), had advised Transport Scotland that it was unable to achieve a target opening date of December 2016.
In response to a question from Mid Scotland and Fife MSP Murdo Fraser, the minister said the bad weather ""exceeded expectations"" and resulted in an increase in the number of days lost to the weather.
He told MSPs that 25 days were lost over April and May due to high winds, using up the time contractors had put aside for contingencies.
Work was also halted in April when a 60-year-old worker was killed on the site.
Mr Brown said contractors remain on schedule to complete the project ahead of the contractual completion date - six months after the December target.
He also insisted that there would be no financial impact or cost to the taxpayer due to the opening date being pushed back, but did admit that ""weather is still a factor"" in the May 2017 target.
The Scottish Conservatives said ministers must now give a date for completion.
Murdo Fraser said: ""This is very disappointing news for people on both sides of the bridge.
""They were continually told by the Scottish government that this project was ahead of schedule and would soon be up and running.
""Now we find this is not the case, so the SNP must now give an exact date when this will be completed by.""
The existing Forth Road Bridge was closed to traffic for almost three weeks in December after a crack was discovered under a truss in the roadway.
Mr Fraser called for assurances that the current bridge is fit to carry on while the new crossing is completed.
""We saw the sheer disruption caused to people and businesses when the existing Forth Road Bridge was closed over Christmas,"" he said.
""It's essential we know whether or not the patch-and-mend approach taken at that point will be enough to ensure it can cope until the Queensferry Crossing opens.""
Mr Brown insisted that the existing Forth Road Bridge could handle an extra six months of heavy traffic.
Labour's Alex Rowley said the delay ""will be greeted with great disappointment in Fife and beyond"".
Stressing that the building of the new bridge remains good news, he said it was ""important that ministers do not announce unrealistic deadlines"", calling for ""full transparency"" in the project.
Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamiltion, whose Edinburgh Western ward includes the southern end of the bridge, said the project was in ""abject distress"".
He queried ""how on earth"" 25 days of delays had caused the opening date to be pushed back 180 days.
Mr Brown said ""everything possible"" was being done to get the bridge open as quickly as possible, in line with safety guidelines.
In February, Transport Scotland said the project was scheduled to finish ""on time and under budget"".
But earlier this week, in the wake of newspaper reports that the opening of the bridge could be delayed, the transport agency would not give a completion date.
Instead, it said FCBC was ""making every effort to open the bridge as soon as possible"".","The new Â£1.35bn road bridge across the Forth will now open in May 2017, six months later than originally planned.",36479440
"His correspondents included David Lloyd George, William Gladstone, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Conan Doyle.
And on his death 100 years ago, obituaries were effusive in their praise, calling him the last of the great Victorians.
You would be forgiven for the name Charles Darwin popping into your head - but you would be wrong.
The theory of evolution by natural selection was published jointly between Darwin and Monmouthshire-born Alfred Russel Wallace, whose interest in natural history developed when he moved to Neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother.
But while today Darwin is a household name synonymous with the theory, Wallace struggles to gain anywhere near the recognition of his friend.
This is illustrated by an appeal this year to raise funds for a life-sized bronze statue to honour Wallace - it only reached half of its Â£50,000 target.
Wallace expert Dr George Beccaloni, who is a curator at the Natural History Museum where the statue would stand, said: ""We have enough money to pay for a torso and arms at the moment.
""There are hundreds of Darwin statues and busts but there's not even a bust of Wallace.
""There's a side-profile roundel on the wall at Westminster Abbey - not far from Darwin's grave. There's not a lot else.""
Interestingly, Wallace was not overlooked during his lifetime and was awarded the Order of Merit, the highest honour that could be given by the British monarch to a civilian.
His correspondents included some of the most significant politicians in recent British history, and celebrated authors and poets.
""He was extremely famous and possibly the most famous scientist and one of the most famous people in the world when he died (in 1913),"" said Dr Beccaloni.
""There were very long, glowing obituaries in all the world's papers from Bombay to Boston saying he was the last of the great Victorians.
""One of the papers said only a great ruler would have had the sort of level of obituary recognition as Wallace.""
He said Darwin was more famous but died many years before Wallace leaving Wallace to go on and become ""the most famous living biologist in Britain"".
So where did it go wrong for Wallace's reputation?
Prof Jim Costa, director of a biological research station in North Carolina, USA, and an expert on both men, says part of the problem appears to be that Wallace failed to promote his role in formulating the theory as effectively as Darwin.
While they had jointly published the theory of evolution by natural selection in a paper in August 1858, it was Darwin's On the Origin of Species the very next year that truly grabbed the public's imagination.
Even one of Wallace's own books appeared to pass on the credit for the discovery. It was called 'Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications'!
Prof Costa said another factor was what became known as the ""eclipse of Darwinism"", when natural selection fell out of favour in the late 19th Century.
By the time it was revived in the 1930s, neither man was around and the world was a very different place.
""I think when this idea was resurrected in 1930 there was a new generation and they very much had Darwin on their minds,"" said Prof Costa.
""Wallace I think had a role in this - his book 'Darwinism' for example. He tended to downplay his role in public forums and that just didn't serve him well.
""When it [natural selection] was resurrected, it was always associated with Darwin.""
He said when evolutionary biology really took off in the 1940s, the history of the discovery had been largely forgotten.
A Darwin ""industry"" developed and, said Prof Costa, it viewed Darwin as the ""great visionary"".
While little has changed since in terms of public acclaim, there are signs that Wallace's work is gaining more recognition in certain circles.
A series of events are being held around the world to commemorate the centenary of Wallace's death this year under the Wallace100 banner.
These include an exhibition in Swansea, a lecture in Berlin and a two-day conference in Malaysia.
Comedian Bill Bailey recently unveiled a restored portrait of Wallace at the Natural History Museum and has also filmed a two-part documentary for the BBC about Wallace.
Thousands of Wallace's letters have been put online for the first time, including correspondence with Darwin about evolution by natural selection.
There is even hope for the statue with renewed efforts being made to raise the rest of the money by August.
But gaining the same level of acclaim as Darwin is another matter.
""I think that in the popular imagination, it would be very, very difficult. It's indelibly Darwin and monkeys,"" said Prof Costa.
""I don't think there's much we can do about that but I do think he will emerge from relative eclipse by Darwin, certainly in the broad academic world and the world of naturalists.
""He contributed so much.""","He jointly came up with the theory of evolution by natural selection, corresponded with the great and good of society, and was given the highest honour possible from a British monarch.",21549079
"""It was extraordinary to have found yourself a symbol of freedom of expression, though for the wrong reasons,"" the 73-year old Bogdanov tells the BBC World Service's Witness programme on the 30th anniversary of his trial.
Accused of procuring an act of ""gross indecency"" likely to cause offence for his production of The Romans in Britain at London's National Theatre, Bogdanov says he felt ""enormous relief"" when the case collapsed and the prosecution withdrew its evidence on the third day of the hearing.
He also says he felt ""very angry"" that the private prosecution brought by the morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse had been allowed to happen at all.
Mrs Whitehouse, he says, ""confused reality with an illusion"" on the stage. If he had been convicted, Bogdanov could have been jailed for up to three years.
Written by the playwright Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, which opened in London in October 1980, was always likely to provoke controversy.
With vivid imagery, strong language and violence, the play sought to draw graphic parallels between the Romans' invasion of the British Isles and the presence at the time of British soldiers on the streets of Northern Ireland.
But it was one short scene involving the attempted rape of a young Druid called Marban by a Roman soldier (""a metaphor for the rape of one culture by another,"" according to the director), that eventually landed Bogdanov in court.
When he was first handed the play by the National's then artistic director, Sir Peter Hall, Bogdanov says he thought it contained some of the best new writing he had read. The attempted rape scene, to be performed with naked actors in full light and centre-stage, was ""brilliantly written"".
But though nudity was not uncommon on the stage - and Bogdanov was careful that no sexual contact was actually made between the actors (the Roman used his bunched up fist and thumb as a substitute for his erect penis) - Sir Peter was clearly worried. He asked Bogdanov to consider moving the scene upstage, in half light.
The director stood his ground, arguing the scene's artistic merit. Sir Peter eventually acceded, but not before warning that there could be trouble ahead.
Though playing to packed audiences, the play's nudity and strong language attracted fervent media attention. But more ominously, it quickly came to the notice of Mrs Whitehouse, then head of the National Viewers and Listeners' Association.
She refused to attend a performance in person but in December 1980 sent her solicitor to watch the play in order to collect evidence. He came back convinced there had been a sexual act on stage likely to cause offence.

Having tried and failed to force the Attorney General to initiate a prosecution against the National, the morality campaigner then began her own proceedings under the 1956 Sexual Offences Act, accusing Bogdanov of being the ""pimp"" who had allegedly procured the act on stage.
Three decades on, Bogdanov's memories of those days are still vivid. He and his colleagues had initially dismissed the possibility of being taken to court, believing their defence of dramatic effect would be enough to discourage a prosecution. But a magistrate and then an Old Bailey judge both ruled that the case should be heard.
Bogdanov became increasingly concerned: ""I can't pretend it was easy, it felt like some huge juggernaut rolling over me, especially when they spent hours discussing whether I should be kept in the cells overnight,"" he says.
Anonymous letters arrived at the family home, while his children became the object of unwanted attention at school. ""At one point I was the only thing on the front pages.""
The collapse of Bogdanov's trial three days after it began was one more act in the long-running drama of The Romans in Britain.
Keen to establish what Mrs Whitehouse's solicitor, and chief prosecution witness, had actually seen on stage, Bogdanov's defence team asked him to tell the jury where he had been sitting in the theatre. ""At the back,"" came the answer - much to everyone's amazement.
Lord Hutchinson, lead defence counsel, leapt up: ""What if I told you that what you thought you saw was not an erect penis, but a thumb?"" And he proceeded to bunch up his fist and thumb under his robes, pulling them aside to reveal his hand to the witness and jury.
Bogdanov, looking on from the dock, says members of the jury burst out laughing, while the prosecution barrister went pale and immediately requested an adjournment. The prosecution withdrew its evidence, and the court set Bodganov free.
Outside the court, Mrs Whitehouse claimed victory. The case, she said, had set an important legal precedent that the Sexual Offences Act could be applied to events on stage and that simulated sex could amount to gross indecency.
But for Bogdanov, the play that got him into trouble has left other lessons. The Romans in Britain, he says, is just one in a long line of stage productions down the years that have caused controversy.
""The thing that gives me most pleasure is that the theatre still has the power to shock,"" he says.

"Police say the Arena clan made money by providing services at Isola di Capo Rizzuto in Italy's far south and siphoning off state funds.
The clan is alleged to have hidden behind a local Catholic charity which officially runs the centre.
The claims came to light on Monday, when officers arrested 68 people, including a local priest.
Another of those arrested was Leonardo Sacco, head of the Catholic Misericordia association that is supposed to control the Sant'Anna Cara immigrant centre. The centre holds 1,500 people at a time.
It is alleged the Arena clan, part of the powerful 'Ndrangheta crime syndicate, may have taken more than a third of the €100m ($109m/£85m) destined for the centre in the past 10 years.
The priest, named as Edoardo Scordio, had received €132,000 already this year for ""spiritual services"", an assistant prosecutor alleged.
Police in Catanzaro, a city in the southern Calabria region, said more than 500 agents were involved in the arrests of suspects ""accused of mafia association, extortion, carrying illegal weapons, fraud, embezzlement to the detriment of the state, (and) theft"".
The arrests come two years after L'Espresso magazine published an investigation, alleging funds were being stolen and managers were making money by starving the migrants who lived there.
A year earlier, it was alleged the number of migrants said to be living at the centre had been greatly over exaggerated, while in 2013 a health inspection found asylum seekers were being fed small portions of out-of-date food.
Police believe the clan, through Mr Sacco, was awarding contracts, including for food supplies, to other members of the 'Ndrangheta syndicate, as well as setting up its own associations.
According to Rosy Bindi, the head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, the centre had effectively been transformed into ""a money printing operation for organised crime"".

"Monarchs are the only insects to migrate such a vast distance.
So, by teaming up with biologists, mathematicians set out to recreate the internal compass they use to navigate on that journey.
The findings are published in the journal Cell Reports.
Lead researcher Prof Eli Shlizerman, from the University of Washington, explained that, as a mathematician, he wants to know how neurobiological systems are wired and what rules we can learn from them.
""Monarch butterflies [complete their journey] in such an optimal, predetermined way,"" he told BBC News.
""They end up in a particular location in Central Mexico after two months of flight, saving energy and only using a few cues.""
Prof Shlizerman worked with biologist colleagues, including Steven Reppert at the University of Massachusetts, to record directly from neurons in the butterflies' antennae and eyes.
""We identified that the input cues depend entirely on the Sun,"" explained Prof Shlizerman.
""One is the horizontal position of the Sun and the other is keeping the time of day.
""This gives [the insects] an internal Sun compass for travelling southerly throughout the day.""
Having worked out the inputs for this internal compass, Prof Shlizerman then created a model system to simulate it.
This consisted of two control mechanisms - one based on the timekeeping ""clock"" neurons in the butterflies' antennae and the other from what are called azimuth neurons in their eyes. These monitor the position of the Sun.
""The circuit gets those two signals then matches them, according to how it's wired, to control signals that tell the system if a correction is needed to stay on the correct course,"" explained Prof Shlizerman.
""For me this is very exciting - it shows how a behaviour is produced by the integration of signals,"" he added.
""We can take these concepts to produce robotic versions of these systems - something [that is] powered by and that navigates by the Sun.""
Prof Shlizerman said that one of his team's goals was to build a robotic monarch butterfly that could follow the insects and track their entire migration.
""It's a very interesting application that could follow the butterflies and even help maintain them.
""Their numbers are decreasing, so we want to keep this insect - the only one that migrates these huge distances - with us for many years.""
Prof Matthew Cobb from the University of Manchester told BBC News that the study showed that ""something as astounding as the monarch migration can be understood in terms of cellular circuitry"".

"They range from extra responsibility for off-street parking, through to tourism.
Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.
Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.
Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.
Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.
From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.
So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?
Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.
Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.
He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"".
But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills?
Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference.""
However, not everyone is so upbeat.
Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.
Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.
James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.""
Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"".
He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place.""
Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.
Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.
Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.
Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.",Northern Ireland's 11 new district councils are due to get a range of fresh powers when they take over local government from 1 April next year.,27493801

"The world champion has made bad starts to both races and is trailing Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 17 points after two victories for the German.
Hamilton said his starting problems were ""not a big issue"", adding: ""It is something we'll fix for the next race.""
And he said he was ""actually pretty chuffed"" about finishing third in Bahrain after a first-lap collision.
Hamilton started on pole but was second behind Rosberg by the first corner, where he was hit by Valtteri Bottas's Williams and dropped to seventh.
The damage to his car cost him between 0.8-1.5 seconds a lap but Hamilton fought back to finish third behind Rosberg and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.
Hamilton said his poor start in Australia two weeks ago was caused by a clutch problem and that in Bahrain ""it was not entirely my fault but it was my reaction time that caused the delay"".
Asked whether he was concerned about having to make up ground to Rosberg, just as he did on his way to the title in 2014, he said: ""Don't worry about it - I'm not.""
He added: ""This is a psychological game for sure, but with age and experience I'm in the most solid place I've been. There's very little that can penetrate that.
""We easily had the pace to win. We didn't. We all feel the pain, but I just said to the guys: 'There is a long way to go; let's not worry about it.'
""I know it will come good. We've had two poles and we'll get more.""
Rosberg, whose victory in Bahrain was his fifth victory in a row including the final three races of last season, said: ""I'm just enjoying the moment - fighting for wins, knowing I'm going to be fighting for the win in China. I'm really not looking ahead.""
However, he said Mercedes were concerned about the threat from Ferrari, whose lead driver Sebastian Vettel retired before the start with an engine failure.
""They showed good pace,"" Rosberg said. ""They are close and they haven't shown what they can do because of various mishaps in the races so far.
""They are coming at us strong and we need to be careful.""","Lewis Hamilton said he was ""not worried"" about his difficult start to the Formula 1 season.",35956182
"The Sorrento was travelling to the coastal city of Valencia when the blaze began and quickly got out of control.
The passengers were evacuated from the burning ship on to lifeboats and have been rescued by another ship.
At least three people have been injured and have been taken to hospital by helicopter, Spanish media say. One is reported to be seriously hurt.
The ship was about 27km (17 miles) from Mallorca when the fire broke out on Tuesday afternoon on one of the car decks. The reason for the fire was unclear.
Several ships including two passenger ferries were sent to help. The passengers and crew on the life rafts eventually boarded one of the ferries, the Puglia.
Spanish officials said the rescued passengers were on their way back to Palma de Mallorca and were expected to arrive at the port in a few hours' time. Psychologists were being asked to go to the port to provide counselling.
""Due to the fire that it has suffered, The Sorrento may sink in the position in which it finds itself,"" the Balearic Islands port authority said in a tweet (in Spanish).
The ferry, owned by Italian company Atlantica di Navigazione, sent out distress signals at 13:50 local time (11:50 GMT), said Spain's Ministry of Public Works.

""Enforcement is a continuous exercise and we have set a target for ourselves. We want to ensure that Lagos is noise-free by the year 2020,"" he said.

"The Local Government Information Unit said 94% of the 131 councils it spoke to were intending to put up bills, with their finances at ""breaking point"".
A third of these, 34% in total, intend to hike bills by more than 2% in April.
Councils, many of whom have frozen bills in recent years, say it will not be enough to plug the funding ""gap"" exacerbated by the cost of social care.
But the government says council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010.
Although councils in Wales were included in the survey, the Welsh government has said it will not allow councils to raise bills to pay for social care.
Ministers say they are bringing forward money to help councils pay for social care by increasing the ""precept"" - a supplement that councils are able to charge on bills - from 2% to 5% over the next two years.
Years of cuts to central government funding since 2011 have put pressure on the budgets of the 375 councils in England and Wales, with many paring back core services. Financial pressures on county councils and unitary authorities that provide adult social care have become particularly acute in the past year.
Surrey County Council abandoned controversial plans this week to hold a referendum on a 15% rise in council tax which it said was needed to pay for social care. It will now increase bills by 4.99% - the maximum it can do without holding a public vote.
Labour have accused the government of doing a sweetheart deal with the Tory-controlled council to call off the referendum - claims it denies.
Publishing its research, the Local Government Information Unit said five district councils which do not provide social care had wanted to hold local referendums to sanction council tax rises above 2% but had ""thought better"" of it in recent weeks.
Inflation, as measured by the CPI index, currently stands at 1.6% but is projected to rise to 2.7% next year.
The LGIU said there was growing concern in town halls that the current system of funding local authorities - through a mixture of government grants, council tax and other income streams such as business rates and parking charges - would become unsustainable in the near future.
Of the 163 council chiefs - across 131 local authorities - which responded to its survey, 42% said future cuts would be ""noticed"" by residents while one in 10 feared the situation might become so serious that they would no longer be able to fulfil their councils' legal obligations to provide certain services.
A number of county councils - including Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland - have already said they will add the full 3% ""social care precept"" to council tax bills next year and many others are expected to follow suit.
Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU, said: ""Local government finances are at breaking point.""
""We see councils around the country patching their budgets by raising council tax, drawing on their reserves and increasing charging. They have very little confidence in the sustainability of the system.
""Councils are allowed to place a 3% precept on council tax to fund adult social care - nine out of 10 of them saying it is not enough money and won't meet the gap. Councils are going to retain 100% of the new business rates - half of councils tell us they think they will be worse off under that new system post-2020.""
He said councils were being frustrated in their efforts to address the problems themselves with revenue-raising measures such as greater scope for charging, local hotel taxes and a re-evaluation of council tax bands ""off the government's agenda"".
""None of these are wild and wacky ideas. They are things that are done in other countries, in the US, France and Spain and they work.
""Here they are not even part of the conversation. That needs to change.""
A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ""Council tax is expected to be lower in real terms at the end of this Parliament than it was in 2010 and we've protected residents by allowing them to veto excessive rises at a local referendum.
""Our historic four-year funding settlement gives local authorities the certainty they need to plan ahead, with almost £200bn available to provide the services that local people most value.
""We've also announced an additional £900m for social care, meaning councils will have £7.6bn of dedicated funding to spend over the four years.""","Scores of local authorities in England plan to increase council tax by up to 5% in 2017-8, according to research.",38929869

The RMT union had claimed some workers on board two freight boats were paid less than Â£4 an hour.
The charter change will see contracted out services return to operator Serco Northlink from next month.
The freight vessels Hellier and Hildasay have been operated by Seatruck, which is contracted to run the service by Serco Northlink.
Seatruck argued the national minimum wage was not applicable to the crew, many of whom are non-UK residents.
Serco Northlink said it had repeatedly offered to bridge the pay gap and backdate it, but Seatruck declined to accept.
Mr Yousaf said the new arrangements would come into force early next month subject to some financial and regulatory details being finalised.

"With a fifth successive title win all but wrapped up, the PFA Scotland Player of the Year says thoughts are now turning to defending the crown next season.
""We're fired up again for next year,"" Griffiths said.
""We've got five in-a-row and next year we'll look at making it six.""
Griffiths scooped the Player of the Year prize after a season in which he has contributed 39 goals, and is humbled to be marked out by his peers as the top player in the country in this campaign.
""As a professional footballer to be voted as the player of the year is the main one, you are playing against teams week in week out and for them to vote you the best player in the country is special,"" said the Celtic striker.
""I still have {my young player award} in the house. My mum's wanting this one, but she's not getting it.""
Griffiths' individual displays have kept Celtic's title defence on-track this season, but failure in the cup competitions and in Europe has left many fans disillusioned with the club, and questioning the direction it is heading.
Failure to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League was an early-season blow, and a winless run in the Europa League did little to appease the Celtic support.
Then came a League Cup semi-final defeat to Ross County and, most painfully of all, a Scottish Cup loss at the same stage to bitter rivals Rangers. These factors combined left manager Ronny Deila feeling he had no option other than to step down at the end of the current campaign.
""We were disappointing,"" admits Griffiths.
""The European campaign wasn't great and the cup defeat against Rangers - everybody said it was a disaster but you know we played one of our worst games of the season and we drew, but got beaten on penalties which we all know is just a lottery.""
""{Players} could've been performing better, you know we've lost silly points in silly games. We were beaten twice by Aberdeen, we've drawn a couple of home games we didn't score in but we still managed to wrap up a league title and that's the most important thing.""
The list of potential candidates to succeed Deila is a long one. David Moyes, Paul Lambert, Malky Mackay, Michael O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Roy Keane - just some of the names that have been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant Parkhead hotseat since Deila announced he would be exiting Parkhead in the summer.
Griffiths has already paid tribute to the Norwegian for coaxing out of him the best form of his career, but says a new man in the dugout represents an opportunity for every player at Celtic.
""Everybody in the changing room is going to have a clean slate,"" said the Scotland international.
""There are players in the dressing room who will be in favour and others who won't be in favour and it will be up to them to work their way back into the squad.
""I've had a good season so far but a new manager coming in will have his own ideas - hopefully I'm part of that plan.""
The football world has been captivated by the fairytale story of Leicester City defying the odds to become Premier League champions. Aberdeen did provide a challenge for the Premiership title, but the feeling among many was that Celtic, for all their shortcomings, would have too much strength in depth over the course of the season.
So it has proved, and Griffiths is pleased that another Leicester-style underdog triumph has not unfolded in Scotland.
""As players we are delighted with what Leicester have achieved as it shows why football is the best sport in the world.  But we don't want any underdogs winning leagues up here, we want it to be us.
""Aberdeen may have run us close this year, but ultimately we want to be Scottish champions at the end of the year.""
Celtic can clinch the title with a point when the Dons visit Parkhead at the weekend.
""The boys are buzzing, we can't wait to go out and confirm ourselves as champions on Sunday.
""We know there's going to be a big crowd coming and we want to send the fans home happy. Hopefully it's three points, we only need one, but we know Aberdeen will come down and make it difficult for us.""
Having established himself beyond doubt as Celtic's leading forward, Griffiths' next target is to gain the same status in the Scotland team.
The former Hibs striker has seven caps to his name, but has yet to establish himself in Gordon Strachan's side, more often than not finding himself behind Steven Fletcher in the pecking order.
Griffiths hopes the end-of-season friendly internationals against Italy on 29 May and France on 4 June will give him a chance to prove his worth before the 2018 World Cup qualifiers kick off with a trip to Malta in September.
""I'm just happy to be back in the squad now and if I get a start I'll be buzzing, if not sit on that bench and wait my turn.
""We've got a lot of good strikers all vying for that one place. You've got to be playing well and in favour so hopefully come the World Cup qualifiers I'll be that man.""","Leigh Griffiths says Celtic are ""fired up"" for next season as they aim to win a sixth straight Premiership title.",36198766
"Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Kulbhushan Jadhav was ""kidnapped"" and tried on ""concocted charges"".
Mr Jadhav was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of ""espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan"".
Shortly after his arrest, Islamabad released a video in which he was shown admitting involvement in spying.
India has always questioned the alleged confession, saying that it was extracted under duress.
There are differing accounts of how and where Kulbhushan Jadhav was detained.
Pakistan says he was detained on 3 March 2016 in the restive Balochistan province, which has been hit by a separatist insurgency that Islamabad accuses India of backing. India says he was kidnapped by Pakistan while he was in Iran.
Speaking in the Indian parliament on Tuesday, Ms Swaraj described the death sentence as ""an indefensible verdict"" and warned Pakistan to ""consider the consequences"".
Home Minister Rajnath Singh promised that the government would do ""whatever it takes to make sure Mr Jadhav gets justice"".
On Monday, Pakistan said he had been tried by a military court and sentenced to death.
Pakistan said he told the court he had been ordered to ""plan, coordinate, and organise espionage/sabotage activities aiming to destabilise and wage war against Pakistan"".
He has 40 days to appeal to the court, Pakistani media report. No date was given for his execution.
The nuclear-armed neighbours have a long history of diplomatic spats and Delhi and Islamabad often accuse each other of sending spies into their territories.
In November, Pakistan withdrew six officials from its mission in Delhi after they were outed as suspected spies by India.
It later leaked to the press the names and photos of eight alleged Indian spies working from India's mission in Islamabad.
But executions for spying are rare. In 1999, Pakistan hanged Sheikh Shamim 10 years after his conviction for spying.

"Cuadrilla, the firm behind the tests, said drilling had been suspended as a precaution after the 1.5 magnitude tremor - the second in two months.
It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey (BGS) before deciding whether to resume.
A tremor centred on Poulton-le-Fylde on 1 April shared a ""similar location and mechanism"", the BSG said.
Shale gas drilling, known as ""fracking"", involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions.
Mark Miller, chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources, said: ""We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts.
""We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that.""
The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite.
But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice.
The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution. There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.
In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: ""Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.
""It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.""
The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.
Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: ""The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.
""Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.
""Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).

"Villa instead appointed Roberto Di Matteo, but he was sacked after 124 days and replaced by Steve Bruce.

""I thought at the time that's their loss not mine.""
The 67-year-old continued: ''There were about five clubs I spoke to. You have to look at that when you get to my age.
""I would not be here if one or two of those things had cropped up, but I am really pleased I am here. It is probably fate.""
Warnock had discussions with a number of clubs in the summer, including Nottingham Forest, before joining Cardiff following the departure of Paul Trollope in October.
Trollope has since been appointed assistant manager at Brighton, replacing Colin Calderwood who left to join Bruce at Villa.
After sacking Di Matteo, who lasted just 12 games, Villa opted for former Hull manager Bruce just a week after Warnock had been installed at Cardiff.
Warnock thinks Bruce is the right man to bring success to Villa following their Premier League relegation as he is a similar manager to himself.
''With Steve and myself you get what you see. I was disappointed I did not get a chance with Villa in the summer if I'm honest, because I thought it would have been ideal to sort everything out,"" Warnock told BBC Wales.
""That is why I am not surprised at all Steve has gone in and done really well.

"In a Scrubbing Up column for the BBC News, Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, says the hundreds of millions of pounds it will cost could be better spent elsewhere.
He said other areas for investment include improving out-of-hospital services and tackling sepsis.
But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC doctors agreed with him.
His claims come despite criticism from the British Medical Association, which has argued he has not given enough detail about the plans or explained how it will be funded.
The BMA has been given until next Friday to agree to discuss the plans with the government.
Plans for a seven-day NHS have provoked a bitter row between the government and doctors' representatives.
Ministers argue thousands of people die every year because there is not the same level of service at weekends as during the week.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, says the government has failed to set out what its policy means in practice, and what it will cost.
It points out that many doctors already work at weekends.
In an exclusive interview and article for the BBC's ""Scrubbing Up"" column, the Nuffield Trusts's chief executive, Nigel Edwards, says a seven-day NHS is a good aspiration.
But he argues the health service is in a world of ""tough trade-offs"", with many hospitals only managing to meet their current commitments by running up deficits.
He concludes the policy is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and suggests - in the current climate - there are better ways of spending the money.
In his column, he says: ""NHS policy is largely made by middle-aged, middle-class men and women who commute long distances into London and Leeds.""
Mr Edwards added: ""I think one compelling priority would be to try and shorten the time that patients stay in hospital.
""A seven-day-service helps a little with that but actually this is more about investing in community services and getting the decision-processes in hospitals a lot slicker. And we could do that, probably, more easily"".
He says there may also be benefits from focusing on individual conditions.
""Another area would be sepsis, which has a very large toll of mortality, probably much more significant than seems to be associated with seven-day working.
""Putting in some measures to spot that early and to intervene in a more effective way would have a big effect on people.""
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has defended the push for a seven-day NHS. He acknowledged there may be ""upfront costs"" of hundreds of millions of pounds, but he told the BBC there may also be similar levels of savings because of improved discharge from hospital.
He also argued the government was investing in other areas such as the new meningitis B vaccine, new cancer drugs and dementia.
And he insisted there was strong support in the health service for the seven-day plan.
""For doctors who are totally passionate that the NHS should offer the best and safest care anywhere in the world, the knowledge that thousands of people die every year because we don't offer the same level of service at weekend as we do in the weeks is something that really worries them.""
The chief executive of the Sepsis Trust, Dr Ron Daniels, welcomed the proposed emphasis on tackling the problem, which kills an estimated 37,000 people every year in the UK.
""Reducing deaths from sepsis is not rocket science but there's been relatively little investment in dealing with the problem.

"Meaning ""to watch a large number of television programmes (especially all the shows from one series) in succession"", it reflects a marked change in viewing habits, due to subscription services like Netflix.
Lexicographers noticed that its usage was up 200% on 2014.
Other entries include dadbod, ghosting and clean eating.
Helen Newstead, Head of Language Content at Collins, said: ""The rise in usage of 'binge-watch' is clearly linked to the biggest sea change in our viewing habits since the advent of the video recorder nearly 40 years ago.
""It's not uncommon for viewers to binge-watch a whole season of programmes such as House of Cards or Breaking Bad in just a couple of evenings - something that, in the past, would have taken months - then discuss their binge-watching on social media.""
Those partaking in binge-watching run the risk of dadbod, one of ten in the word of the year list.
Referring to an untoned and slightly plump male physique, dadbod is not without its admirers, with actors like Seth Rogen and Leonardo DiCaprio fitting the purported brief.
""Once again, the list of Collins' Words of the Year offers a fascinating snapshot of the ever-changing English language,"" said Newstead.

"It comes after Ruskin College's governing body agreed to cut two of its six BA programmes and one of its three MA courses to save money.
College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"".
He said it would continue to focus on adult education.
Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire.
BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued.
Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years.
She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut.
She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"".
The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added.
Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course.
One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them.""
Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"".
Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts.
He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history.
""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added.
The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.","An Oxford college has moved away from its founding principles of providing degrees for working-class adults and mature students, students have warned.",32963257
"The Labour leader has warned the terms of reference, which have yet to be published, could be too ""narrow"" and residents not properly consulted.
He wants an interim report on the cause of the fire by September, followed by a wider probe into building regulations, council funding and other issues.
The presumed death toll stands at 80.
Police have warned the final figure will not be known until at least the end of the year.
The leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, Nick Paget-Brown, which was criticised for its response to the disaster on 14 June, quit on Friday.
Retired former Court of Appeal judge Sir Martin Moore-Bick was appointed to head the inquiry on Wednesday. It will sit in public and have the powers to compel witnesses and obtain evidence.
Visiting the scene of the blaze on Thursday, Sir Martin said he believed the probe and its recommendations would be ""pretty well limited"" to what had caused the fire and its rapid spread.
Setting out his ambition to produce a report within a year, he said he was aware that people in the area want a broader investigation but he was not sure that his inquiry would be the right setting.
The prime minister has said she expects an interim report to be made available as soon as possible and that survivors and residents should be consulted on the terms of reference.
But Mr Corbyn said he wanted a guarantee the initial findings would be published by the end of the summer.
In a letter to Mrs May, he said the inquiry would be best served by being split into two parts to ensure ""timeliness would not have to be sacrificed for rigour"".
While understanding how the fire started was of the ""utmost importance"", he said survivors and other residents had a multitude of other questions about how their safety had come to be compromised and what could have been done to prevent the disaster.
""Whilst the detail of the specific failures at Grenfell needs to be uncovered, it is also clear that the Grenfell fire has much wider implications for national policy issues,"" he said.
The issues that must be addressed, he said, included:
""An inquiry within narrow terms of reference risks failing to learn all the lessons of this tragedy.""
The PM has said the immediate priority is to establish the facts of what happened at Grenfell Tower and to take the necessary action to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.
But she has said the ""wider lessons"" must be learn from both this catastrophe, and the inspections of other buildings around the country that followed it.","The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire must be split in two stages to ensure all lessons are fully learned, Jeremy Corbyn has said.",40460624
"Gray opened the scoring from the spot after Shane Duffy felled George Boyd in the area.
Rovers pressed for an equaliser but Elliott Bennett's powerful effort was brilliantly kept out by home keeper Tom Heaton.
The Clarets are now four points clear of third-placed Hull.
Relive Burnley v Blackburn here
The victory was the first time Burnley had beaten Rovers at Turf Moor in 38 years and took them a point above Middlesbrough, who beat Wolves 2-1 on Friday night.
Paul Lambert's visitors might feel aggrieved they did not get anything from the game, having had 15 attempts to Burnley's eight and being dominant in the second half.
Blackburn also felt they should have been awarded a first-half penalty when Hope Akpan went down under the challenge of Stephen Ward, while Heaton was again on hand to deny Bennett's low drive in the second period.
Michael Keane did have a late chance to seal it for the hosts, but the centre-back scuffed Scott Arfield's delivery when free in the area as Sean Dyche's side held on to a hard-fought win.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche: ""That's my sixth Lancashire derby and I've not seen a decent one yet.
""They've always been tight affairs and we thought it might be that type of game again.
""It was cagey and awkward but obviously I'm delighted we came out on top and it is fantastic for the town and the fans. For me it's three points and another win but for the town it is a different thing.""
Blackburn boss Paul Lambert: ""I thought we should have won. We were brilliant on Tuesday and we were great today.
""I'm sitting here totally relaxed because I thought we played a right good game against a side who have a lot of Premier League players and have more money than us.
""You wouldn't have noticed the points difference today and that's the level I want my players to play at.""

In between, Harry Maguire should have done better with a header which he put wide of goal.
Ibrahimovic hooked an effort wide in the second half and Jakupovic made his best save to prevent Juan Mata from scoring at the back post, as well as keeping out Paul Pogba's curler.
The visitors could have won it with five minutes to go, but on-loan Lazar Markovic's clipped shot came back off the post and Abel Hernandez struck tamely at David de Gea.
The point keeps United in sixth place, but allowed Hull to move off the bottom of the table.
The rules are different for me - Mourinho
Relive the entertaining draw from Old Trafford
Jakupovic made a total of six saves, punching the air in delight with each effort he kept out and taking the acclaim of the jubilant away supporters at full-time.
Hull have shipped 47 goals this season - only Swansea (52) have conceded more in the division - and this was just their second clean sheet in 23 league games.
Asked by BBC Sport if it was his best game in a Hull shirt, Jakupovic replied: ""I try to be my best for the team all the time but today I caught a good day.
""The striker celebrates when he scored, and I celebrated to myself with some saves.""
United striker Ibrahimovic was not impressed by the Hull player's performance. The Swede said: ""I did not see any chances where it was difficult for the goalkeeper. It was not a good save from Mata, it was a bad finish. Some saves he made for the cameras.""
United had seen all the top four sides drop points in this round of fixtures as they chase a Champions League spot, but failed to capitalise even though they had 66% possession in the match.
Despite extending their run to 14 games unbeaten in the top-flight, they have drawn their last three games and are four points adrift of Liverpool in fourth place.
United only had themselves to blame in a wasteful performance. Marcus Rashford, who completed a full 90 minutes for the first time since November, highlighted his team's sloppiness by losing possession 21 times - more than any other player on the pitch.
Wayne Rooney was brought off the bench at half time, but failed to change the game, having become the club's leading all-time goal scorer in the previous league match at Stoke.
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: ""We didn't score. You don't score, it is not possible to win.
""Their goalkeeper was good.
""We needed to score, we needed more time to play. If you played 35-40 minutes in both halves, it is a lot. I think Hull City tried to see where they could go, the way they could behave and tried to see what the referee would allow them to do.
""They had the feedback and were comfortable to do what they did. I am not critical of that. They are fighting against relegation and every point is gold.
Asked by BBC commentator Martin Fisher what upset him about referee Mike Jones' performance: ""If you do not know football, you should not have a microphone in your hand.""
Before this game, Hull had lost nine straight away games, with their last point on their travels coming at Burnley in early September.
But under new boss Marco Silva they have shown enough improvement to suggest they can preserve their top-flight status.
The Portuguese has led Hull to a win and a draw in his first three games - with a defeat coming against leaders Chelsea - and lie four points away from safety.
Having beaten United in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final last week, Hull may even feel disappointed by not taking all three points with Markovic coming agonisingly close to clinching the winner late on.
However, striker Oumar Niasse was lucky not to be given a red card after making late challenges on Michael Carrick and Daley Blind, having earlier received a yellow card.

"So far troops have rescued 150 people from the worst-hit site in central Kegalle district, but hopes are fading for another 134 still unaccounted for.
No more people were found overnight, dead or alive - on Wednesday 14 bodies were pulled from the mud.
Five more bodies were found at the site of another mudslide in the district, bringing the death toll there to 10.
Landslides and flooding caused by days of torrential rain have hit many parts of the country, killing at least 43 people in total, according to official figures. Nearly 350,000 people have been displaced.
In the worst-hit area, Aranayake district, three villages were buried after a huge section of hillside sheared away in the rain on Tuesday.
Bad weather is hampering the army's efforts to reach possible survivors.
""I fear the missing 134 could be dead at this point,"" Maj Gen Sudantha Ranasinghe, the officer in charge, told BBC Sinhala. ""But we will continue our operation to recover the bodies to give families some peace.""
We started to climb up to the disaster site with troops who were going back on Thursday morning to continue to search for survivors. However they suspended their mission and evacuated the area along with us and some villagers who had returned.
Rain was beating down on the collapsed mountain again, creating a risk of further landslides.
We had to take shelter in a tiny schoolroom on higher ground. Villagers we spoke to were losing hope of finding any more survivors.
We waded through mud and silt to reach the foot of the mountain where most of the devastation has taken place. Army units have identified several places where people may have been buried in the landslide.
In one of the villages, Pallebage, local resident PG Sekara said: ""The army keeps going up the mountain, but they're not going to find anything. To find survivors they will have to dig about 40 feet now.""
Prema Adikari said she feared she had lost her brother and his family.
""My brother's house is completely destroyed. They were inside when the mudslide started. His 15-year-old daughter and his wife were also in the house,""  she told BBC Sinhala.
""When it rains, the canal waters nearby get so loud - they had not heard the neighbours warning. Only one member of the family remains, my nephew, who had gone to the shops nearby when the landslide struck. At least we want to see their bodies.""
At Bulathkohupitiya, the site of the second, smaller landslide in Kegalle district, six people are still reported missing.

"The politics is also apparent in the newspaper sales figures for the first half of the year. Out this week, they show the average decline at more than 10% since the first half of last year, continuing the industry's painful downward trajectory.
Scotland on Sunday saw print sales fall more than 20%. It now has an average weekly sale of less than 25,000. It doesn't have its own staff any more, relying on a journalism pool shared with its stablemate, The Scotsman.
""SoS"" is now being beaten by the only weekly ""regional"" paper to register a rise in print sales, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. The Sunday Herald looked to be on its last legs, but found a niche by backing the independence cause.
Approving ""Yes"" campaigners backed it, with a big lift in the back half of last year, from which it's fallen back, but still retained an average 29,000 weekly sales.
Its publisher, Newsquest, also saw a gap in the daily market for pro-independence readers. Although the figures aren't audited, we're told they're selling nearly 17,000 a day.
These are small numbers when set alongside the total sale of newspapers. The constitutional debate may have polarised opinion and changed some buying behaviour, but it can be overstated. The decline of sales in Scotland has recently been steeper than those for the rest of the UK, but the trends are similar.
Meanwhile, publishers point out there's a rise in online readership. But that's not making them enough money to sustain their cost bases. In the case of the Scotsman's figures, daily online readers are down 33% since a busy referendum period.
Those news publishers are competing with broadcasters for online readers. We've just got half year figures for STV which show  it aiming to achieve its turnaround by the end of next year.
A high priority is the desire to find a new earner from making drama series, as royalties from Taggart re-runs fade to black.
It's finding the transition and investing in new services can be expensive, with an Â£800,000 half-year loss on its two city stations, STV Glasgow and STV Edinburgh.
They're being watched by 900,000 people in the average month which, we're told, is 30% of the potential audience. The Glasgow channel is being aimed at break-even by the end of this year.
STV also lost a wad of cash by having to bail out Mirriad, a digital advertising firm in which it invested. It may have failed to raise the finance needed without the bail-out, but it's clever stuff, ""advertising to the skip generation"", with personalised product placement embedded in video content.
For instance, a music video might have a street scene, in which a background billboard has ads which differ, depending on who is viewing.
Advertising is not part of the BBC debate. Not yet anyway. But as the future of the licence fee is discussed, they are a sort of subliminal presence on the background billboards.
A project, financed by the BBC and published this week, sought to find out how small groups of people responded to living without the corporation's TV, radio and online content for a few days.
It concluded the group who resented having to pay the annual Â£145.50 missed it more than they expected, and some were despairing at the impact of adverts on their viewing of commercial channels.
Commissioning that research is part of the BBC's fight for its very existence, at least if you believe some of the interpretation of the government's green paper on how the next 10-year charter is going to change things. The charter is due to start from the end of next year.
We're half way through the consultation on that, and so far the UK government appears to have retreated from the early briefings to delighted print rivals that Auntie might as well be put in a retirement home, her funding clipped, with a remit to leave popular entertainment to the commercial market-place.
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale has been in Edinburgh for its International TV Festival this week, making reassuringly supportive comments about the BBC. He'll be aware that it has a lot of fans mobilised to defend it, including some formidable cultural celebrities. Some, including Armando Ianucci and Sue Perkins, used the Festival platform to sound off.
The context of the debate on the BBC's future in Scotland is, of course, rather different. The broadcaster's fans have not rushed forward to argue the case for it. The independence referendum seems to have left a bruised legacy of reluctance to engage.
It also left a legacy of a starkly changed political landscape, to which the BBC has to respond, even if Mr Whittingdale's green paper didn't make much of it.
The document only noted the Smith Commission's agreement that the BBC should be answerable to Holyrood on a similar basis to its accountability at Westminster (note that it's accountable for its management and use of resources, rather than its output and journalism).
On the pro-independence side, there's some tacit awareness that the broadcasting section was hardly the most compelling part of the Scottish government white paper. It proposed a new Scottish broadcaster while somehow ensuring that all the popular BBC stuff was retained.
Less tacit are vociferous critics of the BBC's political coverage, including pro-independence websites and bloggers, some threatening mass non-payment of the licence fee.
Having mobilised protests outside the BBC last year, that element continues to be fired up by Alex Salmond, in his newspaper column and promoting his book, with ever stronger condemnations of the BBC's referendum coverage.
The body set up to represent viewers, listeners and readers, the Audience Council of Scotland, took 10 months to produce a report that reflected on the referendum. When it did, it was both supportive and quite challenging of the corporation's coverage.
It said online was of ""exceptional quality"" (including something called ""expert economic analysis"" - though if there was, I missed it). But it also said coverage failed to respond to the change in campaigning style, as grass roots and social media played such a significant role.
The Council pointed to ""an opportunity to review issues in the light of experience in the referendum"", though it stopped short of explicitly calling for one.
So that was the complex background to Alex Salmond's successor, previously with little to say on the subject, setting out her thoughts on broadcasting, and the BBC in particular, with a speech at the TV festival.
Nicola Sturgeon said she approached the subject with trepidation. Her speech was very carefully worded. It's hard to believe this was anything like the speech Alex Salmond would have delivered.
Criticism of the BBC's campaign coverage last year was measured. The first minister said she saw no ""institutional bias"", and praised at least some BBC Scotland journalism.
She went on to argue that there was a failure to strike the right balance between holding independence plans up to scrutiny on a parallel basis with the prospects for remaining within the UK.
""The status quo and the consequences of voting 'No' were not really analysed at all,"" she claimed, voicing the irritation of those who feel there wasn't a level playing field.
And she cited the Audience Council in support of her view that London-based journalists had failed to catch the mood of Scots audiences. Their broad brush reports jarred, it was argued, with the detailed scrutiny of issues that had long been debated at every level of Scottish society.
BBC management responded to her speech with a statement beginning: ""We believe our coverage of the referendum was rigorously impartial and in line with our guidelines on fairness and impartiality"".
The Sturgeon speech then turned its focus on the future. For her followers, it's worth noting a change of direction - no longer talk of a Scottish Broadcasting Service splitting from the BBC, but a federal structure.
The design appears to allow for either devolution or independence. That way, it helps to disarm Ms Sturgeon's constitutional opponents in their claims that an independent Scotland would be deprived of Eastenders, Strictly Come Dancing and Sir David Attenborough.
The governance requires a Scottish board of overseers, she said, while the output requires a Scottish TV channel (in addition to BBC Alba in Gaelic), and a sibling station for BBC Radio Scotland.
Her most forthright criticism was of the BBC's past attempts to avoid becoming a leader of constitutional change by refusing the pressure to split its flagship network news coverage, at 6 and 10 o'clock, for a different perspective from Scotland for Scots.
""The criticism that should be levied at the BBC is not that it has tried to lead constitutional change,"" said the first minister. ""It is that it has totally failed to follow it.
""The UK has changed dramatically since devolution, but broadcasters are still catching up with its consequences. And although that poses questions for all public service broadcasters, the issue is maybe most acute with the BBC.""
The message was aimed at Mr Whittingdale to some extent, but more so at the BBC. So how will it respond?
Last month, the official answer to concerns about a lack of trust was to point to large audiences for the flagship news programme, Reporting Scotland. And even last month, these were ""early days"" for a debate about changes to governance.
Not any longer. Not with a BBC Trust survey finding that only 48% of Scots think that the corporation reflects their lives. That's lower than other parts of the UK.
That BBC spokesman's reaction to the first minister's speech continued: ""We recognise that there is audience demand for greater representation and portrayal of Scottish audiences on all BBC services and we want this to be part of our response in charter review.
""The BBC's funding has now been set for the next five years and this will mean cuts across the BBC.

"Sofia Ashraf, 29, posted a Facebook live video of her singing a song, My Vote Is Not For You, in front of the new chief minister's residence.
Sasikala Natarajan, a close aide to the late chief minister J Jayalalitha, was appointed to the post on Sunday.
The decision has fuelled anger as Ms Natarajan has never held public office.
She was made general secretary of the AIADMK party after Jayalalitha's death in December.
The recording of Ms Ashhraf's live video has been viewed 45,000 times and shared almost 1,000 times since it was uploaded to Facebook 18 hours ago.

""The youth are getting increasingly agitated, and this appointment of a woman who has never stood for election being made chief minister was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" Ms Ashraf told the BBC.
""It has made us lose faith in democracy.""
The AIADMK had earlier explained its choice of chief minister.
""Like Amma [mother], we wanted a strong woman leader to serve the people,"" party spokesperson CR Saraswathi told the AFP news agency, referring to Jayalalitha by her popular nickname.
Ms Ashraf says she was performing at a venue two streets away from Ms Natarajan's residence in Chennai (Madras) when her band decided to change the lyrics  to one of her songs.
She and others marched towards the house and transmitted it live on Facebook.
Police tried to stop the recording, but Ms Ashraf told the BBC that those accompanying her argued that she was doing nothing illegal.
""In Tamil Nadu there is a culture of bullying. There is no space for dissent. If you protest on the streets you are arrested, and if you protest on social media you are charged with defamation. This protest was my way of reclaiming both those spaces,"" she said.
""Party workers are asking us to give Sasikala a chance, but let her stand for election first.""
Ms Natarajan's appointment caused a lot of chatter on Indian social media, both in Tamil Nadu and outside, with many expressing opposition to the decision.","A young Indian rapper has taken on what she calls the ""undemocratic"" appointment of the new chief minister of southern Tamil Nadu state.",38880819
"Scotland voted No to independence in 2014 following an often frenzied campaign and a record-breaking turnout of 84.6%.
But things have changed since then - most notably the decision by the UK to leave the European Union.
So have Scottish voters changed their minds?
Ruairidh Forbes was so keen to vote No to independence in 2014 that he delayed moving from Edinburgh to London where he was due to begin a PhD in physics.
Ruairidh, from North Berwick, says he was not convinced that the financial security of an independent Scotland could be guaranteed.
But now he plans to vote Yes.
""I am worried about a decline in science and technology funding in the UK after Brexit,"" Ruairidh explains.
""Independence is our best shot at staying in the EU.""
Ruairidh is now three years into his doctoral studies and sees the benefits brought to the UK by the Â£7.6bn received from the EU for scientific research in 2007-13.
""The British government relies on EU funding to prop up UK science and technology - I am worried that the sector will collapse once Brexit happens.
""This means that we won't be able to take part in visionary research or cutting-edge projects like the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland.""
""There are no contingency plans being laid at Westminster.""
Although there is no guarantee that an independent Scotland would become a member of the EU, Ruairidh believes signs suggest that voting for independence is Scotland's best chance to preserve science and technology research.
But is he worried that this is also a vote for the SNP, a party that he does not support?
""I don't think they are the right party for Scotland - I'm not a nationalist, I see myself as British.
""But I believe the independence movement is motivated by social issues and this is a unique opportunity for fairer politics.""
Hadron Collider: Has it discovered a new particle?
""I used to think Scotland had the ability to do well alone,"" explains Nichola Dadds, who is 50 and lives in Edinburgh.
""I voted Yes to independence in 2014 but a lot has changed since then.""
Nichola wanted to stay in the EU - but now that Britain has decided to leave, she is worried that as a small country Scotland would be marginalised in the European Union.
""Much of Scotland's trade is with the UK or non-EU countries like China or the US - if we left the UK, I am not convinced we could get a good trade deal.
""I would be concerned about joining the EU as a small country. Look at countries like Ireland and Italy - they have little say in Europe,"" explains Nichola.
""I believe if Scotland became independent from the rest of the UK we would end up beholden to the EU and my thoughts are, 'Better the devil you know,'"" Nichola says.
Instability caused by the fallout from Brexit is another reason why she changed her mind.
""I want to vote for stability and security. We have had enough of referendums - it is time to get used to what is going on instead of causing more disruption.""
Scotland's trade with UK rises to Â£50bn
Keeping Scotland out of the European Union is Steven Calvert's motivation to change his vote from Yes to No.
In 2014 Steven, who lives in Inverness, voted for independence as a protest vote against the Conservative government in Westminster.
""I voted yes to escape David Cameron and rule by a party that Scotland did not vote for.
""But now I plan to vote No - I want Scotland to be out of the EU and independence could jeopardise that.""
Steven wants to set up a seafood export business and opposes the fishing regulations that come with EU membership: ""People here talk about how the EU has made it hard for small fishermen to make a living.
""Big trawlers come in from countries like Spain, and we can't find a place to fish.
""I think Scotland leaving the EU gives us the chance for a more sustainable quota, hopefully encouraging restoration of the Scottish fishing industry. That would offer good jobs to young people, especially in rural areas.""
Reality check: the impact of the EU on farming and fishing
Jessica Orr felt ashamed in 2014 that she did not vote for independence.
""I'm very sensible and pragmatic - I felt that it was too risky, but all my friends and colleagues voted Yes,"" she explains.
Now she has a second chance, she plans to do things differently.
""I feel like after Brexit and President Trump's victory, politics has become really degraded and I've realised how positive the independence idea is.
""I'm frustrated that we've been forced to leave the EU despite the fact that Scotland did not vote for it.
""Without the EU, I feel like we will be worse off, and I am frustrated about the changes to immigration policies in the UK.
""Scots are not represented at Westminster and I feel like Scottish political leaders have more integrity than those in Westminster or the US.""

"The Pirates of the Caribbean star will play the title role in Therese Raquin, based on Emile Zola's 1867 classic.
Described as ""a tale of love, lust, betrayal, and guilt,"" the play will cast her as a young woman trapped in a loveless marriage who has an affair with one of her husband's friends.
The Roundabout Theatre Company show opens in October 2015 in New York.
Knightley, who turns 30 next year, previously trod the boards in London in The Misanthrope and The Children's Hour.
The actress has two films out next month in the UK - World War Two drama The Imitation Game and US comedy Say When.
Therese Raquin has been staged and filmed many times, most recently as the film In Secret starring Elizabeth Olsen.
The new version is by British playwright Helen Edmundson, who previously adapted the Tolstoy novels Anna Karenina and War and Peace for the stage.
Knightley appeared in a 2012 film of Anna Karenina and has also appeared in film adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Ian McEwan's Atonement.
Therese Raquin begins previews on 1 October and has its opening night on 29 October at a Broadway theatre yet to be announced.
Earlier this year Knightley revealed she had hoped to take The Children's Hour to Broadway but could not work out the scheduling with co-star Elisabeth Moss.
""We tried to make it happen, but our scheduling didn't work out,"" she told The Advocate. ""It was a real shame, because it would be great doing it on Broadway.""",British actress Keira Knightley is to make her Broadway debut next year in a stage version of a famous French novel.,29747341
"Six people were aboard a raft on the Thunder River Rapids ride when it flipped after a collision with another raft.
Police said it was ""almost a miracle"" that a boy and a girl who were on the raft survived.
Friends and colleagues of those who died have been speaking out.
Kate Goodchild, 32, was on a family holiday to attend a wedding, and decided to extend their trip to go the Gold Coast theme park.
She was a public servant in Canberra and had two daughters with her husband Dave, a 12-year-old girl and an eight-month-old baby.
She was travelling on the ride with her 12-year-old, who survived the collision, and with her brother Luke Dorsett and his partner Roozbeh Araghi, both of whom died.
Ms Goodchild's mother, Kim Dorsett, having lost a son and a daughter, said her family has been ""wiped out"".
""They really were just wonderful people - that would be the best way to describe them. They were kind, loving souls that would honestly do anything for anyone,"" she told News Corp Australia.
""I have two granddaughters ... and it truly breaks my heart to know that my eight-month-old is never going to get to know her mum.""
Luke Dorsett, 35, and his partner Roozbeh Araghi, were known for winning a high-profile legal battle with Canberra's local government over stamp duty in 2014.
Mr Dorsett and his sister both worked for the Department of Human Services.
""Kate and Luke were well-liked and respected by their colleagues and will be greatly missed,"" a department spokeswoman said in a statement.
Radio presenter Patricia Karvelas praised Mr Araghi and Mr Dorsett as loyal friends.
""They never missed one of my girls' birthdays. They never forgot to check in,"" she said. ""Words fail me.""
A friend said both men were amazing.
""Canberra is a very small gay community, everyone knew them or knows someone who knew them,"" Douglas Robinson said on Facebook.
It is understood that Mr Araghi, 38, was originally from Sydney where he studied history and edited the student newspaper, Honi Soit.
He worked for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which in a statement described him as a hardworking member of its communications team ""who brought joy and fun to the workplace"".
Australian Senator Sam Dastyari said he grew up with Mr Araghi.
""I'm devastated that such a caring, loving, sweet and sensitive friend has been lost,"" Mr Dastyari wrote on Twitter.
""I'm angry that this could happen at a venue like Dreamworld.""
Mr Araghi's family found out about his death from a TV news report.
""My second son found out accidentally on the news,"" said Mr Araghi's father, Behrooz.
""We've lost one son,"" he added, ""The mother of my son's partner lost two [children].""
Cindy Low, 42, originally from New Zealand, lived in Sydney with her husband Matthew and their 10-year-old son and six-year-old daughter.
She was on a holiday to the Gold Coast with her family and some other friends, according to media reports.
Whilst queuing for the ride, she decided to separate from her husband and daughter, choosing instead to travel in a separate raft with her son and four strangers.
The decision proved fateful to her, though her son miraculously survived.
Her husband and her daughter who were in the other raft, were both unharmed but extremely distressed.
""She just kept screaming 'Where's Mummy? Where's Mummy?' eyewitness Claire Wooley said of the young girl moments after the accident.

"The 36-year-old, who rejoined the club in the summer after nine years away, made a telling debut with a 90th-minute winner to get the Shrimps off and running for the new season.
Jim Bentley's side had to come from behind after debutant Mohamed Eisa gave the Robins the lead two minutes from the break in controversial circumstances.
Kyle Storer swung a free-kick in from from the left and after Danny Wright headed across goal, the summer signing was on hand to poke the loose ball home from close range - with the Shrimps furious that a push by Wright had not been seen by referee Antony Coggins.
The visitors went close to scoring a second six minutes after the restart when Jordan Grimes saw a close-range volley hit the post after an Alex Kenyon clearance fell perfectly for him.
Three minutes later the Shrimps levelled through Thompson, who slid in at the far post to steer home an excellent low cross from Aaron Wildig after a swift Morecambe counter-attack.
Thompson then provided the telling moment of a tight game at the death when he volleyed home from Vadaine Oliver's header across goal to take the points.

"Llanberis Mountain Rescue was called out a record 43 times to Wales and England's highest peak in August - an increase it called ""unsustainable"".
Visit Wales' recent year of adventure campaign encouraged to visitors to ""Find Your Epic"".
The tourism body said the campaign was ""an opportunity to promote safety"".
Llanberis Mountain Rescue said many of those tackling the peak were unprepared in terms of knowledge and equipment, with many needing assistance.
Chairman of the team of volunteers, Rob Johnson, said ""serious consideration"" needed to be given to how the 3,560 ft (1,085m) peak was managed.
He said the drive to attract tourists contributed to an ""unsustainable"" rise in callouts - from 34 in August 2015 to 43 in August 2016.
The organisation relies on donations and about 1,000 volunteer hours were spent attending incidents - including an RAF helicopter crash landing.
He said many of the callouts were preventable and, with the right knowledge and equipment, they could have been avoided.
""We've attended a variety of incidents this summer but the most common have been lower-leg injuries, people too tired to continue and people crag-fast on Crib Goch,"" said Mr Johnson.
""It has been a massive commitment from a small group of volunteers.""
Visit Wales, the Welsh Government's tourism team, said it encouraged visitors to participate in activities with accredited providers.
A spokeswoman added: ""The year of adventure is also an opportunity to promote safety in the great outdoors.
""Mountain rescue teams do great work in helping people, but as the adventure sector continues to grow there is no doubt rescue teams will need the help of educators in minimising the risk of people needing their assistance.
""That's why we will continue to work with partners and the industry so that people can enjoy Wales and be safe.""","A drive to attract tourists has led to an increase in ill-equipped walkers and climbers becoming stranded on Snowdon, rescuers have claimed.",37275914
"Probably not - for two sets of reasons.
First, the basic facts have not changed - there is no doubt that the situation inside the Labour Party remains dangerously unstable, with probably a majority of Labour MPs deeply uncomfortable with Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
But his is a leadership his party members want, overwhelmingly so. And were a coup to be staged the membership would either re-elect him, or elect someone similar.
We're in Bertolt Brecht territory here: the easiest solution for Corbyn-sceptic MPs would be to dissolve the party membership and elect another, as the poet ironically suggested for the Communist regime in 1953.
But, failing that, they have to wait for the membership to change its mind.
The tactics of any coup attempt revolve around the different views of what might have to occur to trigger such a change.
Some think serious electoral reverses in next May's round of elections (the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, the London mayor etc) might do the trick.
London could be particularly significant, both as the place where Labour did best at the election in May and as the heartland of the Corbynistas.
The argument is that the election of a Tory mayor and a rough ride on the doorstep might re-educate enough of the new wave of Labour members to allow a different leader to be elected.
Others argue that it might take two such rounds of May defeats to change enough minds. This, of course, relies on those defeats actually occurring, not to mention them having the effect the anti-Corbyn camp want. We shall see.
And it's also worth underlining that the Syria intervention is an issue where Mr Corbyn is in tune with his membership.
Then there's the not insignificant question of how a leadership challenge would be triggered.
I'm told some Labour MPs have been digging into the archives to study how Hilary's dad, Tony Benn, went about challenging Neil Kinnock, in 1988, and that legal opinions on what Labour's murky and overlapping internal rules might actually mean are being studied in various Westminster offices.
One of the key questions is whether Mr Corbyn, if challenged, would need to be nominated by 35 MPs in order to defend his position or whether he would be assured of an automatic position on the ballot papers.
Second, there's the climate within the parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). One of the key problems for the coup plotters is identifying an alternative leader, to play Michael Howard to Mr Corbyn's Iain Duncan Smith, and at least keep the Labour show on the road in the 2020 election.
Mr Benn has certainly put his head above the parapet - but he's done so on an issue that is highly divisive within the PLP, rather than one of the several causes which pit most Labour MPs against their leader.
Take a look at the voting list on Wednesday, where two married couples - Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey and Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith - were split on the issue.
In that agonised atmosphere, Mr Benn's moral certainties may not play well in the longer term, whatever their on the day impact.
He may have given a masterly Commons performance (a real rarity these days) and made a powerful speech setting out the moral case for military intervention, in terms that had many Tory, as well as Labour, MPs swooning.
""He's clearly running for the leadership - but of which party?"" tittered one SNP MP.
But most of Mr Benn's Labour colleagues were conflicted about the issue of whether intervention would workâ€¦ and I'm not sure the appeal he made to their internationalist roots and to memories of Arthur Greenwood ""speaking for England"" in 1940 will have won over those who doubt both their leader and the case for military action.
Certainly there were plenty of MPs from what might be called the ""right"" of the PLP who didn't back the government motion.
So it may be worth watching other figures who didn't break cover last night - Rachel Reeves, anyone?
All the same, Mr Corbyn's position has been weakened. He was forced to concede a free vote, under the threat of losing much of his shadow cabinet.
He was comprehensively outperformed by his shadow foreign secretary and some of his internal critics suspect that competence rather than ideology might be the most corrosive issue for his leadership.
This week also saw brutal meetings of the shadow cabinet and the PLP, and, ultimately, a significant chunk of the front bench voting with the government (Hilary Benn, Michael Dugher, Maria Eagle, Angela Eagle, Vernon Coaker, Tom Watson, Lucy Powell, Heidi Alexander, Chris Bryant, Gloria De Piero and Luciana Berger, for the record).
And that list included one of his personal left-field picks for high office, the shadow health secretary Ms Alexander. She's proved an effective performer, but I suspect her name is mud in the Corbyn inner circle.
Now there will be recriminations and, possibly, attempts at constituency level to deselect the recusants (there does not have to be a return to the '80s era of mandatory reselection; the coming Commons boundary changes will ensure most sitting MPs will not face a simple rubber-stamping to become their party's candidate again).
If they succeed, some MPs may quit immediately, forcing uncomfortable by-elections, or simply go rogue in the Commons and vote as they please.
We're still some way from further 80s retro developments like an SDP-style breakaway. And defections to the Liberal Democrats seem improbable, both because of the extent of their implosion last May and because a lot of Labour MPs regard the party's new leader, Tim Farron, as ""Corbyn lite"".
So we're left with a destabilised official opposition and no obvious way to resolve its problems that does not involve a major smackdown.
Things will get worse in the Labour Party before they get better.

"Earlier this week, a councillor in the Scottish Borders said she believed people were being short-changed by the rollout of the service.
BT has said it has invested heavily in providing services in areas where it was not commercially viable to do so.
It has also pointed out that there are a wide range of factors at play in determining the speeds received.
The BBC Scotland news website asked for your experiences of the service in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.
Iain Rennie emailed: I live in the village of Ednam. Barely 2 miles from Kelso. We get a max of 1.5Mb.
It is frustrating in the extreme to see constant TV adverts for high speed broadband when ours is too slow to stream or watch BBC iPlayer etc.
As far as I'm aware there is no date or plan to upgrade this area.
Byron Raistrick, of Ruthwell, emailed: Since the announcement by the Scottish Executive that the initiative was up and running, I've not seen any evidence of the Â£126m being distributed fairly and efficiently to the areas that need it most - rural locations.
Major cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh would have been upgraded as a matter of course by BT Openzone to cater for the businesses there and in turn the residential areas would have benefited, yet (they) have been upgraded first with the money.
Linda Lonsdale emailed: We pay extra money to get superfast broadband and it is not any faster load of rubbish conned again.
Susan Cook emailed: Broadband speed in our village  0.9Mb and sometimes even lower. We have been told by BT that it will be four to six years before we get anything better! And we pay the same as all their other customers.
There are  people living in the Borders other than in Melrose and Galashiels yet no consideration is given to them.
Siobhan Liehne emailed: We live on the Mellerstain Estate near Gordon. We keep reading of ministers complaining that constituents in some Borders areas are ""only getting 2Mbps"". Frankly I would give my eyeteeth for that kind of speed.
We get 0.7 Mbps if we are lucky and sometimes it drops out altogether. Then we have to see signs up telling us that towns only a very short distance away are getting superfast. When we ring BT to try and find out when things are going to improve we get someone in India telling us that it must be our computer.
If it is, then it's every computer on the estate, no matter how new it may be.
Andrew Gray emailed: I live near Chirnside in the Scottish Borders which is enabled for fibre broadband. However only those residents who live within a mile of the cabinet can get anything like the speeds advertised.
My house is two and a half miles from the cabinet so the fibre signal does not reach it at all. According to most comparison websites (including BT's) I can receive broadband speeds of up to 40Mb but in practice I get just over 2Mb, if I'm lucky.
There should be further scrutiny of how public money has been spent on improving broadband services, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone can benefit in the future.
Henry Sinclair emailed: I live in Earlston and have what the major players call ""superfast"" broadband - ie fibre to the cabinet, which is 100m away or just over 200m of copper wire.
The actual speeds I get vary between 20 and 70Mbps download and 15 to 20Mbps upload.
My grandson who lives no more than 400m from me and 300m from a cabinet can only achieve a max of 6Mbps and pays the same as me.
Copper is a 19th century answer to a 21st century question but BT continues to squander taxpayers' money on using it to provide an inadequate or in some cases no service while the solution is staring it in the face.  As the internet moves from a consumer model to an interactive one the pathetic download speeds and risible upload speeds will hold us all back and eventually our interconnection system will have to be re-engineered using fibre.  Why not do it now rather than throwing billions at a known fatally flawed approach?
Brian Telfer emailed: I have had issues since BT started to enable the Hawick exchange well over a year ago. I was getting better speed and reliability before the exchange was enabled for fibre.
I am now on fibre at double the price, with continual buffering drops in service and regular visits from engineers who contradict each other - speed can be from 1.52Mb to 20Mb - not the 52 Mbps I am paying for.
Uploads are a joke - I now use my phone tethered to the computer to upload anything!
Peter Dorward emailed: I read your report with interest particularly the part that referred to over Â£8m being invested in super fast broadband by SBC and that 94% of homes will have it.
At the moment why not focus attention on getting something like 'normal' broadband speeds to all households.
We have struggled at trying to conduct work when at home when only being able to access broadband internet with speeds that are barely any better than a dial up service!
Any pressure that can be brought to get us to first base is welcomed.
Carole emailed: We live in Bonnington Road in Peebles in a modern house and our broadband speed is very poor we are with BT and get 2Mb which is a joke. Believe one of our neighbours gets better speed. When you try to raise it with BT you don't get anywhere. Poor show ... what's fibre optic? Even a bit better speed would be appreciated fibre optic is a dream for us.
David Jeffrey emailed: I work in broadband provision for local councils in the south of the country. I believe the councillor is correct in her assertion of expecting speed provision to be constant.
Both BT and the industry are living in the last century of squeezing the last penny of investment out of the copper infrastructure in the ground.
Admittedly fibre is not cheap, but the trial in York proves that fibre to the home is achievable with the right partnerships (CityFibre, Sky and TalkTalk in that case)
Digital Scotland should be delivering more, but as long as BT have the monopoly over the infrastructure, nothing will change.
However, this constant and reliable speed will come at a cost, and there is the rub. Will subscribers pay for it?
I expect not. It is worth noting that businesses in south of Scotland (and anywhere else in rural UK) have enjoyed fibre services for many years, but have had to pay top whack for the privilege.
Brian Heslop emails: I live in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway. We're on a farm, so were considered too remote for coverage, the cabinets are located within a few hundred yards of the exchange so the cabinet is still 2.5 miles from the house.
As the exchange is one where the one broadband provider is BTopenreach, so all the advertised cheap offers from EE, TalkTalk, Sky etc are not available. So the double hit of slow broadband and the highest prices.
Part of the problem is the politicians not understanding what BT are selling them, it was never going to give a good service to all, using an urban solution in a rural environment.
Lindsay Lewis emailed: We are lucky if we get 1.5Mb because we are several miles from the exchange.  BT have not upgraded our exchange (Yarrow)  and seem unlikely to do so.  Why?  Because there aren't enough people/customers to make it worth their while.  It is a disgrace - we pay the same as someone getting up to 50Mb, and what makes it even more galling is that BT are continually sending us marketing material urging us to sign up to BT Infinity!  So for the foreseeable future we will continue to live in the digital dark ages.
Jason W emailed: BT need to wake up and smell the coffee.
Copper phone lines are dead assets - they will need to be replaced with fibre optic right to the premises sooner or later. If the cost of upgrading to actual fibre to the premises wasn't so outlandish, I'd do it in a heartbeat.",The speed of broadband in southern Scotland has provoked some intense discussion.,36488825
"The 51-year-old had been negotiating a release from his contract following a rift with the board over his budget.
Hughes has been with the Highlanders since December 2013 and won the Scottish Cup last year, the club's first major honour.
""John will be remembered as a member of a great winning team,"" read a brief statement from Inverness CT.
Hughes had become increasingly frustrated at the loss of key squad members and spoke of his disappointment when an approach from Dundee United was blocked earlier this season.
Having previously managed at Falkirk, Hibernian, Hartlepool and Livingston, he replaced Terry Butcher at the Caledonian Stadium.
As well as lifting the Scottish Cup, Hughes steered Inverness to a third place finish in the Premiership last season, with this campaign opening with their first taste of European football.
In March 2014, Inverness reached the League Cup final, losing on penalties to Aberdeen.

"She had come prepared to own up to her mistakes, apologising to the gathered throng just as a few hours earlier she had apologised to the cabinet.
It had been her decision to call the election, and her leadership of the campaign that faltered and in what was described as the most human performance they had seen for quite some time, Theresa May said sorry, time and again.
""We saw the human being, not the Maybot""; ""it was the first time in seven weeks she didn't say strong and stable""; more poignantly for the Tories MPs who commiserated with each other, ""if she'd campaigned like that, we'd have won"".
They were cheered, relieved perhaps, that she had, tonight, managed to pull it off, to show regret at the calamity her decision to go to the country had unleashed, relieved too that she rose to this particular occasion that seems likely to settle nerves enough to avoid the possibility of the party plunging into another leadership election and potentially therefore, another general election that they might lose.
The sense of immediate danger to her leadership has faded. But while her enemies are not breathing down her neck, they are still in the room.
One MP told me she wasn't asked any hard questions but deliberately took the time to take all of them, to show willing, ""her strategy has been to take as many questions as exist"".
It's like that episode of the West Wing where the Presidential Candidate Vinick was in deep trouble, so he took endless questions until the press finally got tired and went home - apologies if the American series isn't your thing, but it's an obsession of rather a lot of Westminster types.
While publicly it is tonight the done thing for Tories to be fulsomely on the record praising the prime minister, privately it's hard to find a single MP who believes that she will take the party into the next general election.  PM survives first bout of battle for control
It is, however, also very hard to find a single MP who wants to unleash even more potential chaos by triggering an election contest, let alone a general election.
But it's the circumstances, rather than newly discovered rapture, for the PM that have saved her.
One former cabinet minister told me ""having a Tory prime minister is much more important than our own wound licking"". Another minister told me in the medium term it is ""hard to see how"" the PM can stay.
Theresa May has survived the first bout of what will be a fight to stay in control. The election has redressed the balance, not just between the two main parties, but also between the Tory leader and her party.
And the PM knows it, most tellingly also saying to her MPs tonight, ""I'll serve as long as you want me"". Hardly a bold statement of a leader who feels they are in charge, but an acknowledgement that others will decide when their time is up.","In the slightly sweaty committee corridor outside the meeting of Tory MPs tonight, MPs were queuing to praise the prime minister.",40254482

"""[President Barack] Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems,"" he tweeted. ""Forget Syria and make America great again!""
Two years ago Mr Trump built a winning presidential campaign around this very theme, sharply criticising Democrats and some fellow Republicans for what he viewed as their overly interventionist foreign policies.
Just a week ago Secretary of State Rex Tillerson appeared to be following this new script when he downplayed calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's removal, saying his status ""will be decided by the Syrian people"".
Then on Thursday night, two days after another chemical weapons attack, President Donald Trump ordered a guided missile strike on a Syrian government airfield.
The move marks a dramatic turnaround from Mr Trump's prior rhetoric and the expectations of how he would conduct his foreign policy.
In his remarks following the missile strike, the president explained that it was in the ""vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons"".
He even called on ""civilised nations"" to end the ""bloodshed and slaughter"" of the Syrian civil war and insisted that ""peace and harmony"" will prevail.
The man who was thought to be a neo-isolationist now, just months into his presidency, is projecting US military force abroad to enforce international norms and punish human rights abuses.
What changed? It seems clear that the graphic images of dead and dying Syrian civilians - including ""beautiful babies"", in Mr Trump's words - had a dramatic effect on the president's disposition.
With a few notable exceptions, the strike is being praised by Washington politicians on the left and on the right. In the coming days, however, some serious questions will be posed.
If the president's foreign policy outlook can shift so dramatically in just a few days, if not hours, will allies and adversaries interpret this as a sign of flexibility or incoherence?
A cruise missile strike is a low-risk form of military action, but it also is of limited effectiveness.
A White House official described this as a warning shot across Mr Assad's bow.
If the Syrian president continues to use chemical weapons or conduct conventional attacks that result in significant civilian casualties, will the US escalate its military intervention or back down and risk appearing weak?
When Mr Obama contemplated using force against the Syrian government, he decided that he would need congressional authorisation to do so. Will Mr Trump now seek approval from the lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, who were reluctant to give the Democratic president such approval?
Thursday night was Mr Trump's first significant foreign policy challenge, and it appears to have dramatically changed his outlook, his rhetoric and his resulting actions. The candidate who constantly spoke of putting America first ended his brief remarks on Thursday night by calling for God's blessings not just for his nation but for the ""entire world"".
This strike - and this change of attitude - may simply be a one-off event. Or, perhaps, an unlikely globalist has been born.","Four years ago, after the Syrian government launched a brutal chemical attack on its own civilians, Donald Trump warned anyone who would listen that the US should refrain from launching retaliatory military strikes.",39525265
"The 23-year-old Ivorian broke hearts across Great Britain when he snatched victory from Lutalo Muhammad in the last second of the men's -80kg taekwondo Olympic final.
It was the Ivory Coast's first Olympic gold and he has, since Rio, become a national hero.
He has been gifted a new house and a 50 million CFA franc (£65,400) cash bonus.
Not bad for an athlete who only has access to poor facilities and finds it hard to raise funds to meet his training costs.

"There were about 19,000 diagnoses in 2015, compared to about 17,300 in 2006.
Public Health Wales (PHW) said the main reason for the increase was an ageing population.
The organisation's Dr Dyfed Wyn Huws said there was ""good news"" by way of significant reductions in smoking rates in recent decades.
There was a year-on-year decrease from about 19,800 cases in 2014, but the 2015 figure of 19,088 is likely to increase as statisticians revise the numbers.
Once age factors are taken into account, the rate decreased by more than 5% in men, but increased by more than 5% among women between 2006 and 2015.
This is partly due to the rate of lung cancer going down in men, but up among women. Historically, smoking rates peaked far earlier among men than women.
Breast, prostate, lung and bowel cancers remain the most common.
According to PHW, cases of liver, mouth, throat and melanoma skin cancer saw the biggest percentage increases.
The rates of stomach cancer and prostate cancer decreased, while mesothelioma rates increased by almost a third.
Dr Huws said: ""We know that up to four in 10 of cancers in the population may be preventable.
""With an increasing number of cancer cases each year, cancer control is possible and important for future generations and for keeping rising health service demand in check.

"She met with pupils and staff at Burnfoot Community School in Hawick on the first day of their new term.
It is one of two primaries in the region benefiting from the Scottish Attainment Challenge programme.
The latest allocation of Â£2.8m is being distributed to 46 primaries across 12 local authorities.
It is part of the Â£750m that the Scottish government said it intended to invest in the Attainment Scotland Fund over the course of this parliament.
""As a new school year begins today, pupils and parents here at Burnfoot Community School are looking ahead to an exciting and stimulating year of learning,"" said Ms Sturgeon.
""I am determined that every child must have the same opportunities and an equal chance to succeed.
""That's why our top priority is raising attainment overall and closing the gap in achievement between young people in our most and least deprived areas.""
She said that in areas of deprivation across the country, teachers were already developing innovative approaches to improving literacy, numeracy, health and wellbeing.
""At Burnfoot, for example, there has been a significant focus on family support, family learning programmes and links with the wider community,"" she added.
Scottish Borders Council's executive member for education, councillor Sandy Aitchison, said Burnfoot was an ""excellent example"" of schools working to ""close the attainment gap"".
""The school has initiated a range of interventions aimed at closing the gap and since joining the Scottish Attainment Challenge this work has intensified,"" he said.
""This has had a tremendous impact on children and their families including improved attainment in reading, writing and numeracy, as well as improved attendance of pupils.""
Liz Smith of the Scottish Conservatives said everyone agreed tackling the attainment gap should be the ""first priority"" for schools.
""The ambition should be about ensuring young people have good quality early years provision, and that they get access to top class local schools, teachers and support staff with a wide range of subject choice and extra-curricular activities,"" she said.
""None of these things can happen with the SNP's current approach.
""We need radical reform in our schools which allows headteachers to have more control and which allows parents both more involvement in and more choice over their child's schooling.""
Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said his party had outlined a ""series of positive policies"" to cut the gap between ""the richest and the rest"".
""We would scrap unfair charges for exam appeals, which favour private school pupils over those educated in state schools, and we would introduce a Scottish Graduation Certificate to replace the failing baccalaureate,"" he said.
""Whilst the First Minister poses for photo ops in the Borders, her government is only delivering attainment funding to two schools out of 63 in the area.

Ulster twice opened a seven-point lead through tries by wing Craig Gilroy and full-back Jared Payne.
In a week when the Welsh Rugby Union announced they intend to take over the region, Dragons hit back with scores by Rynard Landman and Ollie Griffiths.
Paddy Jackson's kick edged Ulster ahead before Rodney Ah You was shown a red card and Andrew claimed the key try.
Ah You was dismissed after he was adjudged to have made an illegal shoulder charge on Dragons full-back Carl Meyer.
The win means Ulster stay fourth in the Pro12 table, but their failure to gain a bonus point means fifth-placed Scarlets have reduced their cushion to three points with four matches remaining.
Playing for the last time this season at Rodney Parade, Dragons were dominated in the early stages and were seven points down within 10 minutes thanks to Ruan Pienaar's vision and Gilroy's footwork.
The South African scrum half's kick into space bounced horribly for the defenders and Gilroy dribbled the ball into space and touched down near the posts.
The Welsh region dominated possession for the rest of the half, at one stage going through 32-phases, but never really looking likely to score a try.
O'Brien's penalty was cancelled out by Pienaar with Carl Meyer' long-range penalty off target to leave Ulster with a seven-point half-time lead.
A debatable yellow card for Gilroy gave the Dragons a bridgehead which Landman turned into points with a rumbling lineout drive. O'Brien's conversion levelled the scores.
But before the Ulster wing had returned to the field of play full-back Payne cut a clever line to cross for his side's second try.
Dragons, in 10th-place in the table, again hit back with flanker Griffiths charging down a clearance and being given the benefit of considerable double and awarded the try after several TV replays.
Jackson's penalty with eight minutes remaining edged Ulster back ahead before Ah You' careless challenge reduced his team to 14-men with six minutes remaining.
Ulster rallied and kicked for the corner with Andrew claiming the crucial try from the driving lineout.

"The planned deal was worth £10.3bn, and would have left the UK with just three major mobile phone network operators.
But Europe's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said she had strong concerns about the takeover, ruling that it would reduce customer choice and raise prices.
CK Hutchison said it was considering a legal challenge to the decision.
""The goal of EU merger control is to ensure that tie-ups do not weaken competition at the expense of consumers and businesses,"" said Ms Vestager.
""We want the mobile telecoms sector to be competitive, so that consumers can enjoy innovative mobile services at fair prices and high network quality.""
The decision ruled that concessions offered by Hong-Kong based Hutchison - including a five year price freeze and billions of pounds in investments - ""were not sufficient to prevent"" the hampering of innovation and network infrastructure development.
CK Hutchison responded to the decision, saying the acquisition of O2 from Spain's Telefonica would bring ""major benefits to the UK not only by unlocking £10bn of private sector investment in the UK's digital infrastructure but also by addressing the country's coverage issues, enhancing network capacity, speeds and price competition for consumers"".
O2 said the ruling had little impact on their UK operations. ""We work in an industry of constant change and have learnt how to manage that change better than most,"" said an O2 spokesperson.
""Regardless of what happens next, we will continue to deliver for our customers as we always have.""
It was the deal that was supposed to be the final stage in the reshaping of Britain's mobile phone market. But now the O2/Three marriage has been blocked by Brussels, where does that leave phone users?
Better off, according to regulators. The UK's communications regulator Ofcom, in particular, had argued that allowing the number of players in the market to fall from four to three would inevitably lead to higher prices, poorer service or both.
This sounds convincing in the short term. But, says much of the telecoms industry - if you look at the longer term health of Europe's mobile market - today's move is bad news for everyone.

The commission points out that retail prices in the UK are currently amongst the lowest in Europe, with the four major network operators also including Vodafone and BT's Everything Everywhere, known as EE.
These four operators - who own infrastructure like telecoms masts - have cooperated to share the costs of developing that infrastructure. And it is the collapse of these cost-sharing deals that seriously worries the European commission.
Meanwhile Liberty Global - the owner of Virgin Media - has said it would not rule out an acquisition of O2 if CK Hutchison's bid was ultimately unsuccessful.
""It would be strange if we didn't evaluate that option,"" chief executive Mike Fries told analysts on a recent results conference call.
Liberty Global currently possesses a minimal share of the UK mobile market subsidiary Virgin, which acts as a so-called ""virtual operator."" That means it must pay wholesale prices to access the network operated by BT's EE. Tesco and Asda operate their own virtual networks in a similar manner.
Liberty Global recently ended negotiations for a major tie-up with Vodafone across Europe, settling simply for a Netherlands joint venture.
Kester Mann, a mobile operators analyst at CCS Insight, said global telecoms giants like Japan's Softbank or Mexico's America Movil could also be plausible buyers of O2, but that the ""most likely eventual outcome"" was a sale to a private equity firm.
""The collapse of the deal leaves both Three and O2 in a precarious position with uncertain futures in the UK,"" Mr Mann said.
A spokesperson for the British telecoms regulator Ofcom said that it was the ""right outcome"" for mobile customers.
""Competition must be sustainable, and regulation should support it,"" said Ofcom. ""We will aim to do so through tools such as market reviews or auctions of mobile airwaves.""
The European Commission has intervened in several proposed telecoms deals recently.
A merger between the Danish operations of TeliaSonera and Telenor was abandoned last September after the commission investigated the deal.

"Staff in Jobcentres, banks, building societies and utility companies in England could also be trained to spot - and counsel - vulnerable people.
The ideas are raised in a consultation paper on suicide prevention.
The Samaritans said councils should have a mandatory responsibility to try to prevent suicides in their areas.
Some 4,400 people killed themselves in England in 2009.
Claire Wylie, head of policy and research at the Samaritans, told the BBC News website that many suicide attempts were made on impulse, so trying to restrict access to potentially lethal means was important.
""We know that people who are feeling suicidal are often very ambivalent about actually ending their lives,"" she said.
""If you can interrupt them at that moment you can prevent them going ahead.""
Preventing deaths by jumping is a key aim of the consultation and it suggests a number of ways of doing that.
They include:
Overall, the number of suicides has steadily fallen in recent years, but the number of deaths on Britain's rail network had been rising until last year.
However, specialist training from Samaritans for rail staff was key to an 11% fall in 2010, according to the Rail Safety and Standards Board.
London Underground is also rolling out training to all of its staff after a pilot project at one station close to a psychiatric inpatient unit helped reduce suicides.
The government wants to see that sort of training given to a much wider range of people who come into contact with individuals who could be vulnerable because of their social or economic circumstances.
Jobcentre and benefit office staff, as well as employees in banks, building societies and utility firms are among those suggested in the consultation.
Ms Wylie said: ""More training for all frontline staff is really important, but that needs investment and money is tight.
""In general, we really welcome the government's strategy, but there needs to be a lot more actual commitment to action.
""There's also an issue about local implementation because things like putting up signs and barriers depend on the individual local authority actually caring about suicide prevention.
""We would like to see a mandatory responsibility placed on local authorities to take this seriously.""

"Many of the country's 32 local authorities had voiced concerns about a 2% fall in their income.
Mr Swinney told the local government and regeneration committee he did not underestimate the ""on-going challenges"".
However, he believed councils had been given a ""very credible settlement"".
I think some of the talk has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement for local government.
The minister said that in 2016/17, local authority spending would be cut by £350m, which equates to a 2% reduction.
Mr Swinney insisted that headline figure was not the full story.
He explained to MSPs: ""When we take into account that £250m is going to be spent through the integrated joint boards to support expenditure on services which local authorities are key participants, and given the guidance that I have issued to local authorities as to what they can expect that fund to support, that result is a net reduction in the local authority budget of about £100m, out of £16bn, which equates to less than 1%.""
For the last seven years local authorities have carried out a deal with the Scottish government whereby council tax bills have remained frozen.
However, this year Moray Council considered a move to increase council tax bills by 18% to ease the cuts burden.
It decided not to go ahead with the plan because it would have resulted in the Scottish government withholding £1.1m to offset the freeze.
Council leader Stewart Cree said: ""We simply cannot proceed with the proposal as the extra penalties it would now attract would have a devastating effect on the services people in Moray tell us they want protected.
""So to make ends meet this year the administration have decided to defer certain works and spending, and to draw the remaining shortfall from reserves.""
Responding to a question about Moray Council's proposal to drop the tax freeze, Mr Swinney said: ""I think some of the talk we have heard has been frankly over the top about the impact of the settlement on local government.
""I don't underestimate the on-going challenges in delivering public services within a constrained financial environment.""
He added: ""In all, I think the settlement offered to local government is a very credible settlement, it certainly doesn't merit the type of description it has had from certain voices within local authorities and it most definitely does not merit an 18% increase in the council tax.""
Separately, Scotland's first minister has called on councils to ""do the right thing"" and accept the funding deal being offered by the Scottish government.
Nicola Sturgeon insisted local authorities were being given a ""good deal"" as part of the budget, with a package containing resources that will help them pay the living wage to care workers.

Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide after shooting dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, but cleared of murder.
The prosecution has argued for a minimum 10-year jail sentence.
Speaking to South African broadcaster eNCA, Aimee Pistorius said there was ""obviously a lot of anxiety"" ahead of the sentencing, and that the last 20 months had been ""very taxing"".
She said she felt ""heartache for both my brother, our family and of course Steenkamp's family and her friends"", adding that both families would struggle to move on.
""It's something that you never really get closure on... It's something that my brother will carry with him for the rest of his life.
""It is important for us that [Ms Steenkamp's family] know that she was very much cared for and loved, and accepted as part of our family in the short time that she was with us... [Reeva] had a wonderful charisma and zest for life that she just exuded and it was easy to just fall in love with her.""
She added: ""The truths had been twisted and manipulated, and things have been sensationalised. It causes hurt when things are also reported as fact when they are not.""
Carl Pistorius said the hardest part of the situation was ""all the negative media, polarised publicity, twisted truths and untruths, and how that infiltrates your life regardless of whether you try to or try not to follow the media"".
""It permeates the very atmosphere of everywhere you go, including those that are close to you,"" he said.
He added that he could not speculate on the outcome of the sentencing, but said ""tomorrow will also be very difficult. This is a weight that we all carry"".
The high-profile, seven-month trial has captured public attention in South Africa and beyond.
Pistorius, a Paralympic sprinter, denied murdering Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year, saying he shot her by mistake, fearing there was an intruder in the house.
Ms Steenkamp, a model, reality TV star and law graduate, was hit three times by bullets shot through a toilet door by Pistorius at his home in the capital, Pretoria.
Last month, Judge Thokozile Masipa cleared Pistorius of murder, but convicted him of culpable homicide, saying he had been negligent.
There is no legal limit on the length of a jail term, but experts say the typical maximum sentence for the crime is around 15 years.

Mr Johnson is an active ambassador for the mental health charity Mind.
He recently presented the documentary Iselder a Fi (Depression and Me) discussing his own personal experiences with depression for S4C.
As well as appearing in The Point, he will also be the executive producer.
He said the script was ""one of the best he's ever read"".
""It wonderfully tackles the hugely important issues of mental health in a distinct, moving and humorous way.""
Mr Warry said he was ""made up"" with Mr Johnson's involvement and hopes to start shooting in November.
He said they will be using local talent wherever possible, both in front and behind of the camera.",A Welsh feature film which tackles mental health issues is due to be shot in Powys later this year.,40004104
"For the media - both in Pakistan and abroad - the issue is clear enough: the Pakistani Taliban did it.
Not only has the organisation claimed the attacks. but the intelligence service ISI also recorded real time messages from handlers to the gunmen in the school.
Those messages, the ISI has told journalists, came from the phones of Afghan-based, Pakistani Taliban organisers.
But in Peshawar even people who witnessed the attack hesitate to blame the Taliban by name.
They not only fear reprisals but are also following the hesitancy of a political elite that remains largely unwilling to name and condemn the Pakistani Taliban in unequivocal terms.
Even on the day of the Peshawar school massacre, the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, failed to condemn the Taliban by name. He referred only to ""terrorists"".
An alternative narrative relating the school attacks is already emerging: rumours are circulating on social media and on the streets that it was the work of Indian or Afghan intelligence agencies.
The fact that some of the attackers appear to have come from Central Asia lends weight to suggestions that there was a foreign hand in the attacks.
The emerging analysis of the school massacre echoes that which occurred after the shooting of Malala Yousafzai.
Initial shock eventually transformed to the almost mainstream view in Pakistan today that Malala is a western stooge.
That's not to say the school massacre has had no impact on public opinion.
When a radical cleric attempted to justify the attack this week, protestors gathered outside his mosque in Islamabad chanting anti Taliban slogans.
That's new. But there is still no big name politician prepared openly to lead people with that point of view.
That is in part because the Pakistan's civil and military elites are so divided and dysfunctional.
The politicians have a number of reasons for leaving the fight against the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to the army.
Privately, government ministers argue that the army's total control of security policy means it is unreasonable for the generals to expect the civilians to take responsibility for what the army decides to do.
The politicians are anyway deeply suspicious of an army that has frequently mounted coups to overthrow elected governments.
The current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was kicked out of power, put in a dungeon and then exiled by the last military ruler Pervez Musharraf.
Sharif believes that despite his overwhelming popular mandate the army has never accepted his political comeback in 2013 and is once again plotting to remove him from power.
In addition many politicians fear the Taliban.
The one party to attempt a political challenge to the Taliban in recent years, the Pashtun nationalist ANP, has faced relentless attacks on senior party cadres.
The ANP's stand was also politically disastrous.
Far from perceiving the party as a valiant defender of liberal values, the electorate concluded the ANP was weak and unable to defend itself. The party now has just one member of the National Assembly.
But if the politicians loathe the generals, the feeling its entirely mutual.
Many officers view Pakistani ministers and parliamentarians as corrupt and depraved, unwilling to put aside their lust for money and to focus instead on the plight of the country.
There is deep resentment in the army that when soldiers die in the fight against the Taliban, ministers do not make public speeches appreciating their sacrifices.
Ministers rarely go to military hospitals to comfort soldiers injured in the fight against the Taliban.
It's estimated as many as 50,000 Pakistanis have been killed in political violence since 9/11.
Members of the security forces including both the army and the police account for around 10,000 of those deaths.
Successive army chiefs have said that if they are to win the war against the TTP they need the politicians to lead Pakistani public opinion to support their military's campaign.
But while the army complains about the politician's failure to take clear line against the Taliban, others wonder how clear cut army policy is.
There are now well over 30 significant militant groups with a presence in Pakistan, each with different leadership structures, funding arrangements, ideological foundations and political goals.
The three most powerful are the Afghan Taliban, the TTP and the Punjab-based Lashkar-e-Taiba which concentrates its efforts on Kashmir and India.
Given the scale of problems faced by the Pakistan army, it is perhaps not surprising that it has decided to fight only those groups that are directly confronting it.
That means many Pakistani based militants are free to organise attacks on targets outside of Pakistan. For example, the anti Indian Lashkar-e-Taiba operates in Pakistan with little difficulty.
Western and Indian critics of the Pakistan army believe the army policy in fact goes much further.
They allege that the army does not just give some groups a free pass but, in fact, effectively controls them and uses them to advance the military's foreign policy goals.
By backing the Afghan Taliban, for instance, it ensures that the power of what Pakistan considers hostile elements such as the Tajiks is kept to a minimum or by backing Lashkar-e-Taiba it can advance the Pakistan cause in the disputed region of Kashmir.
The military strongly denies those claims.
While the army clearly does distinguish between different militant groups there can be no doubt that for some years now it has been confronting the TTP.
And its sometimes brutal campaign has had considerable success.
In 2009 the TTP had a high degree of control of 18 administrative units in north west Pakistan including some entire tribal areas.
The army campaign of the last few months pushed the TTP out of its last major redoubt in Pakistan; North Waziristan.
The TTP are now hemmed into to small pockets of territory in remote areas near the Afghan border,   and its leadership has been forced to take refuge in Afghanistan.
Soon after the school massacre the Pakistan army chief Raheel Sharif went to Kabul to demand action against the Afghan-based TTP leader Mullah Fazlullah.
He took transcripts of the intercepted school massacre conversations with him.
But General Raheel Sharif's request is almost certain to run into a significant obstacle.
In return for moving against the TTP leadership on its soil, Afghanistan will expect Pakistan to move against any Afghan Taliban leaders sheltering in Pakistan.
It is believed that for many years now senior Afghan Taliban leaders have sought sanctuary in and around the Pakistani city of Quetta.
So once again Pakistani regional goals could undermine its fight for stability at home.
The army's desire to win more influence in Afghanistan through the Afghan Taliban could jeopardize its victories at home against the TTP.",The vast majority of Pakistanis may be united in grief for the school children murdered in Peshawar  - but many say they still don't know who carried out the attacks.,30520596
"The computer program, which is inspired by the human brain, learned how to play 49 classic Atari games. In more than half, it was as good or better than a professional human player.
Researchers from Google DeepMind said this was the first time a system had learned how to master a wide range of complex tasks.
The study is  published in the journal Nature.
Dr Demis Hassabis, DeepMind's vice president of engineering, said:  ""Up until now, self-learning systems have only been used for relatively simple problems.
""For the first time, we have used it in a perceptually rich environment to complete tasks that are very challenging to humans.""
Technology companies are investing heavily in machine learning. In 2014, Google purchased DeepMind Technologies for a reported Â£400m.
This is not the first time that a machine has mastered complex games.
IBM's Deep Blue - a chess-playing computer - famously beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in a match staged in 1997.
However, this artificial intelligence system was pre-programmed with a sort of instruction manual that gave it the expertise it needed to excel at the board game.
The difference with DeepMind's computer program, which the company describes as an ""agent"", is that it is armed only with the most basic information before it is given a video game to play.
Dr Hassabis explained: ""The only information we gave the system was the raw pixels on the screen and the idea that it had to get a high score. And everything else it had to figure out by itself.""
The team presented the machine with 49 different videogames, ranging from classics such as Space Invaders and Pong, to boxing and tennis games and the 3D-racing challenge Enduro.
In 29 of them, it was comparable to or better than a human games tester. For Video Pinball, Boxing and Breakout, its performance far exceeded the professional's, but it struggled with Pac-Man, Private Eye and Montezuma's Revenge.
""On the face it, it looks trivial in the sense that these are games from the 80s and you can write solutions to these games quite easily,"" said Dr Hassabis.
""What is not trivial is to have one single system that can learn from the pixels, as perceptual inputs, what to do.
""The same system can play 49 different games from the box without any pre-programming. You literally give it a new game, a new screen and it figures out after a few hours of game play what to do.""
The research is the latest development in the field of ""deep learning"", which is paving the way for smarter machines.
Scientists are developing computer programs that - like the human brain - can be exposed to large amounts of data, such as images or sounds, and then intuitively extract useful information or patterns.
Examples include machines that can scan millions of images and understand what they are looking at: they can tell a cat is a cat, for example. This ability is key for self-driving cars, which need an awareness of their surroundings.
Or machines that can understand human speech, which can be used in sophisticated voice recognition software or for systems that translate languages in real-time.
Dr Hassabis said: ""One of the things holding back robotics today, in factories, in things like elderly care robots and in household-cleaning robots, is that when these machines are in the real world, they have to deal with the unexpected. You can't pre-program it with every eventuality that might happen.
""In some sense, these machines need intelligence that is adaptable and they have to be able to learn for themselves.""
Some fear that creating computers that can outwit humans could be dangerous.
In December, Prof Stephen Hawking said that the development of full artificial intelligence ""could spell the end of the human race"".

"The Mid-Infrared Instrument (Miri) will gather key data as the $9bn (Â£5.5bn) observatory seeks to identify the first starlight in the Universe.
The results of testing conducted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK have just been signed off, clearing Miri to travel to America.
James Webb - regarded as the successor to Hubble - is due to launch in 2018.
It will carry a 6.5m primary mirror (more than double the width of Hubble's main mirror), and a shield the size of a tennis court to guard its sensitive vision from the heat and strong light of our Sun.
The observatory has been tasked with tracking down the very first luminous objects in the cosmos - groupings of the first generation of stars to burst into life.
To do so, Webb will use its infrared detectors to look deeper into space than Hubble, and further back in time - to a period more than 13 billion years ago.
""The other instruments on James Webb will do massive surveys of the sky, looking for these very rare objects; they will find the candidates,"" explained Miri's UK principal investigator, Prof Gillian Wright.
""But Miri has a very special role because it will be the instrument that looks at these candidates to determine which of them is a true first light object.  Only Miri can give us that confirmation,"" she told BBC News.
JWST is a co-operative project between the US (Nasa), European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies.
Europe is providing two of the telescope's four instruments and the Ariane rocket to put it in orbit.
Miri is arguably the most versatile of the four instruments, with a much wider range of detectable wavelengths than its peers (5-28 microns).
Fundamentally, it is a camera system that will produce pictures of the cosmos.
But it also carries a coronagraph to block the light from bright objects so it can see more easily nearby, dimmer targets - such as planets circling their stars. In addition, there is a spectrograph that will slice light into its component colours so scientists can discern something of the chemistry of far-flung phenomena.
Miri is a complex design, and will operate at minus 266C. This frigid state is required for the instrument's detectors to sample the faintest of infrared sources.  Everything must be done to ensure the telescope's own heat energy does not swamp the very signal it is pursuing.
The hardware for Miri has been developed by institutes and companies from across Europe and America.
The job of pulling every item together and assembling the finished system has had its scientific and engineering lead in the UK.
Miri has just gone through a rigorous mechanical and thermal test campaign at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire.
This included shaking the instrument to simulate the pounding it will receive during the ascent to orbit on the Ariane.
It was also put in a vacuum chamber and subjected to the kind of temperatures it will experience in space.
""It's been a real privilege to work on Miri and great to see it finally ship out,"" said Paul Eccleston, the engineer at RAL who has overseen the test campaign.
""It will be so exciting when we put it on top of the rocket and light the blue touch paper, so to speak, and watch it go up into space.""
The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa.
The next step is for Miri to be put in a special environment-controlled shipping box, so it can travel to the US space agency's Goddard centre. The Maryland facility is where the final integration of James Webb will take place.
Miri will be fixed inside a cage-like structure called the Integrated Science Instrument Module and positioned just behind the big mirror.
The years to 2018 promise yet more testing.
Recommended 16 years ago as the logical evolution beyond Hubble, the JWST has managed to garner a fair amount of controversy.
Technical difficulties and project mismanagement mean the observatory is now running years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over-budget.
Elements of the US Congress wanted to cancel the telescope last summer.  That did not happen, but Capitol Hill now has James Webb on a very short leash, with Nasa required to provide monthly updates on milestones met or missed.
Much of the talk around James Webb tends to centre on cost.  The current estimate for the US side is $8.8bn, which covers the full life cycle of the project from its inception to the end of initial operations.  Extra to that bill is some $650m for the European contributions like Miri and Ariane.
Dr Eric Smith is Nasa's deputy programme director for James Webb.  He believes taxpayers do appreciate the venture.
""When you're able to show people that James Webb will do things that not even Hubble can do - then they understand it,"" he told BBC News.
""People recognise how iconic Hubble has been, and how much it has affected their lives.
""The images and scientific results that Hubble has returned have permeated popular culture. Webb pictures will be just as sharp but because the telescope will be looking at a different part of the spectrum, it will show us things that are totally new.""",One of Europe's main contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is built and ready to ship to the US.,18006933

Retailers 'left behind' as consumers change habits
How long will you wait for a shopping website to load?
The US Commerce Department will release retail sales figures on Friday that are expected to further underline online sales growth outstripping those at brick-and-mortar stores.
Nordstrom, which has more than 340 stores in the US and Canada, said about a quarter of sales in the three months to March were online.
It has tried to counter the rise of rival online retailers by opening more of its discount Rack stores, investing in the popular online menswear brand Bonobos and other tweaks such as speeding up its website.
Macy's is adding discount areas to its stores, striking deals to stock exclusive fashion lines, and making it easier for customers to try on shoes without a sales assistant.
Macy's chief financial officer, Karen Hoguet, said putting collection points for online purchases at the front of the store - rather than forcing customers to find their way to a counter at the back - has actually boosted sales.
Mr Gennette, who took over in March, said Macy's hoped to introduce a new store format next year, but the company is still forecasting a fall in sales for the full year.
""How and when will you grow again is what's been on your mind,"" he told analysts. ""We certainly don't have the answers yet, but we're working on them with great urgency.""
Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said Macy's now has a ""better sense of direction"" than it once did, but added: ""However, the distance it needs to travel over the next few years is enormous.

"At least 1.8 million more households will be looking to rent rather than buy a home by 2025, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) claims.
It has called on the government to offer tax breaks to encourage building and investment in the sector.
The Conservative Party has indicated its focus remains on home ownership.
The number of UK households renting property rose from 2.3 million in 2001 to 5.4 million in 2014, according to Rics.
It said that any further investment in property by landlords had been hit by changes to stamp duty in April.
Anyone buying a home that is not their main residence must now pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated.
This led to a spike in property purchases in March, with transactions falling quickly again thereafter. Next year, landlords are likely to be hit again when their right to deduct their mortgage interest from their income tax bill is removed.
Rics suggests that the stamp duty increase should be reversed, a move which would infuriate potential first-time buyers - many of whom say they are regularly outbid by buy-to-let investors.
Generation Rent, a group that campaigns for better conditions for tenants, said the higher rate of stamp duty was a good thing.
""It does give first-time buyers a much-needed advantage against people who are simply betting that house prices will keep going up,"" said Dan Wilson Craw, the policy manager of Generation Rent.
""In the first three months of the surcharge, the tax on second homes raised £424m - that cash could help build new homes for people on low incomes.""
A body that represents landlords said that rents were likely to rise.
""Tenants will be hurt most, as landlords recover the stamp duty increase by charging tenants more,"" said David Cox, the managing director of the Association of Residential Letting Agents (ARLA).
""The simple answer is that we need to build more homes.""
In addition to a reversal in the stamp duty increase, Rics also called for:
Rics' call comes just a day after Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said the government would take ""unprecedented steps"" to encourage construction of homes for people to buy.
He told the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham that the housing shortage was ""a huge issue for our country"" and would be his ""number-one priority"".
He said: ""Far too many young people cannot get a foot on the housing ladder. Many are being forced to live back with mum and dad as rents soar faster than wages.""
Among the plans announced was an Accelerated Construction scheme, using £2bn of new public sector borrowing to make public land with outline planning permission available to builders.

"However, the government has insisted there is a link between the attack and Syrian Kurdish fighters.
Prosecutors and security officials said DNA tests had identified the bomber as Abdulbaki Somer, born in the eastern Turkish city of Van.
Last week's bombing killed 29 people, at least 20 of them military personnel.
""The bomber's DNA matches that of Abdulbaki's father,"" a senior Turkish security official told Reuters news agency.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency quoted prosecutors confirming the report.
It said that Abdulbaki Somer was believed to have joined the Kurdish militant PKK group in 2005 at the age of 16 and was based in the Qandil mountains in northern Iraq until 2014.
The agency said that Somer's father had told police that his son was behind the attack.
Following the blast in Ankara, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu named the bomber as Salih Necar, a Syrian national and member of the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).
""Whatever the judicial inquiry concludes over the identity of the bomber, it is clear that the bomber came from Rojava, the area of the PYD,"" Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus told reporters on Tuesday, referring to another Syrian Kurd-controlled northern Syria.
He said the bomber had entered Turkey from the region in the summer of 2014.
Turkish newspaper the Hurriyet suggested that Abdulbaki Somer may have re-entered Turkey with false papers under the name Salih Necar.
The PKK, which has been fighting for Kurdish self-determination since 1984, is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey and its Western allies.
Turkey has also designated the YPG a terrorist group, but its allies, including the United States, back the YPG in its fight against so-called Islamic State (IS).","The bomber behind a deadly blast in the Turkish capital Ankara was Turkish-born, security officials say, not from Syria as the government initially said.",35644396

"Advertising plays a central role at Christmas, and for over 100 years has extended its reach from posters to radio, TV and now online.
Successfully making that last leap has become the holy grail of Christmas advertising.
""The strategy among the retailers now is to get the ad into a prime time spot,"" says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research agency Conlumino.
""From then on TV becomes less important as the message goes off into social media, where there is less cost and the reach can be phenomenal, far greater than TV.""
So, let's look at how that works with one of the most famous, the John Lewis ManOnTheMoon commercial.
In early November it launched the ad, telling the story of a small child who sees a lonely old man through a telescope living on the moon, and sends him a Christmas present by balloon.
Conventional wisdom might assume that the campaign should spark interest in the retailer - John Lewis - but there's barely a mention of the name.
Instead the aim seems to be to spark interest in the ad itself.
To this end John Lewis actually advertised the advertisement with a 10 second teaser commercial a week before it went live, and fired up social media interest with the #ManOnTheMoon hashtag.
Three hours after the advert was aired, #ManOnTheMoon was trending with 40,000 tweets.
And it doesn't stop there. Of the Â£7m spent on the campaign, John Lewis spent only Â£1m on the ad itself, which is just the tip of a merchandising iceberg.
There's an app offering moon-related information. There's a tie-in with a game that can be played on mobiles, sending your presents to the moon by balloon, though at this point Christmas sentimentality is abandoned in favour of eluding surface to air missiles.
Then there's a link-in with ManOnTheMoon telescopes, pyjamas, bedding, mugs and so on.
""The key to the John Lewis ad is that people no longer watch real-time television,"" says Jacques de Cock of the London School of Marketing.
""They defer their watching to Netflix or YouTube, and to capitalise on this market advertisers have to make their ads into social phenomena.""
The reality is that companies are having to make contact with a customer whose habits are dictated not by TV but by the internet.
For instance, view the new Harvey Nichols commercial and the last frame has a ""Shop Now"" button to take you straight to the store.
You can't do that on TV.
But the customer is doing a lot more than just clicking and buying Uncle Cedric's Christmas socks on Amazon.
He or she is researching, comparing prices and browsing online, before either clicking or physically marching into the store and demanding the socks over the counter.
According to Forrester Research, by 2020, 53% of retail sales across Europe will be influenced one way or another by the online world.
So it is not important to an advertiser by what mechanism the money is spent. What matters is where the customer makes up his or her mind - and that space is increasingly a digital one.
All of which shapes the way ads are made.
Sainsbury's advert ""Mog's Christmas Calamity"" written by the writer and illustrator Judith Kerr runs for a full three and a half minutes. The traditional TV ad break spot could never support that on a regular basis - but the internet can.
Lifting time restrictions allows for a great deal more creativity. For instance, the Mulberry Christmas commercial turns the gift of a red bag into a parody of the Nativity, attended by shepherds and Wise Men, which is witty both visually and verbally (""It is a thing of wonder"" extols one of the Wise Men).
And there are other opportunities to add nuances to your brand.
Click on the end of the Sainsbury's commercial and up come links to Judith Kerr's book, the making of the commercial, Save the Children, competitions, recipes and of course Sainsbury's produce.
""We love working for retail,"" says James Murphy, chief executive of adam&eveDDB, which made the John Lewis ad.
""Retail is the new rock and roll in advertising. It is a great shop window for your creativity and for your effectiveness.""
Some might argue the industry is taking itself a teensy weensy bit too seriously. The Burberry Christmas commercial, borrowing its theme from the play/movie Billy Elliot, rolls its own credits at the end.
Bizarrely, the prize for the most viewed ad this Christmas goes to the German supermarket chain Edeka which has been shared 2.39 million times online, leaving John Lewis (1.3 million) and Sainsbury (917,000) trailing in its wake.
It tells a tear-jerking tale, that some might find in questionable taste, of an old man abandoned by his family at Christmas, until, by faking his own death he manages to bring them round the table for Christmas dinner.
Edeka doesn't have an international retail operation. Yet the ad appears on YouTube with English subtitles, suggesting the commercial is as interested in its own brilliance as it is in trying to sell a product.
Supermarket chain Aldi tried to puncture this sort of self-indulgence by making a parody of John Lewis's ManOnTheMoon ad with the frail old gentleman debating whether he should buy a cheaper telescope at Aldi.
But it raises the question - does any of this actually increase sales?
Marks and Spencer tried to tap into this market in 2014, with its Magic and Sparkle TV commercial showing fairies carrying out gratuitous acts of generosity.
The fairies gathered 42,000 Twitter followers and the campaign was hailed as the most imaginative social media event of the year.
But it didn't work in terms of sales and Christmas turnover slumped.
""The campaign is only successful if you have the right product at the right price,"" says Neil Saunders.
""People may want to come to the shop, but if they can't find what they want they won't buy.""
This year M&S has avoided story-telling and instead opted for what is little more than a glitzy montage of its wares.
However, Robert Jones head of new thinking at agency Wolff Olins argues the campaign was still effective.
""It may not have worked in terms of Christmas sales - but this is part of a long term strategy to create an image. You can't change the way people see you in a single year.""
So is the John Lewis ad working?
On the big discount day, Black Friday, sales were up 4.8% on last year. But it is worth noting that whatever the long term effect, the only John Lewis item featured in the ad - a telescope - had sold out online five hours after the ad went live.","The internet is reinventing the Christmas TV commercial, making it more creative, more ambitious - and arguably more self-regarding.",34745809

"The judge cited a possible conflict of interest in the case of Asia Bibi.
Hundreds of riot police had been deployed around the Supreme Court in the capital, Islamabad.
Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Pakistan - critics argue laws are frequently misused to settle personal scores, often targeting minorities.
Last year the Supreme Court suspended Asia Bibi's death sentence and gave her leave to appeal.
A new date for the hearing has yet to be set.
Judge Iqbal Hameed ur Rehman, one of three set to hear the appeal, recused himself from the case on Thursday.
""I was a part of the bench that was hearing the case of Salmaan Taseer, and this case is related to that,"" he told the court, AFP reports.
Mr Taseer was the liberal governor of Punjab province. He was killed by his own bodyguard in Islamabad in 2011 after speaking out for Asia Bibi.
Family in hiding
Asia Bibi was the first woman to be sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws and her case is one of the most controversial.
She was sentenced to hang in 2010 for insulting the Prophet Muhammad during an argument with Muslim women which began over a cup of water. She denies the charge.
Thousands have protested against her and said they would kill her if she were ever released - including the imam in her own village. Her husband and four daughters live in hiding and say they have received many death threats.
Asia Bibi's death sentence had been confirmed by the High Court in Punjab province in October, although no date was set.
Correspondents said the granting of leave to appeal by the Supreme Court was the first glimmer of hope for her family.
Her lawyers say the trial and subsequent appeal in the Punjab high court were flawed.
Pakistan has never executed anyone for blasphemy but some people accused of the offence have been lynched by crowds. Lawyers, judges and those seeking to reform the blasphemy laws have also been threatened, attacked or even killed.
Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been convicted for desecrating the Koran or for blasphemy.
While most of them have been sentenced to death by the lower courts, many sentences have been overturned due to lack of evidence.
Muslims constitute a majority of those prosecuted, followed by minority Ahmadis.",A Pakistani Christian woman on death row for blasphemy has had her appeal adjourned after one of the judges refused to hear the case.,37641354
"Many favourites were simply wiped away: Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, even Eric Pickles. Was Boris Johnson their only consolation?
It was no better for female impersonators: while Nicola Sturgeon was a welcome new voice, the grim reality dawned: it would no longer be possible to put off doing Theresa May.
""My life flashed before me and Miliband wasn't in it,"" Rory Bremner told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour.
""I lost Galloway, which was a tragedy for impersonators everywhere,"" says Lewis Macleod, of Dead Ringers.
Pondering his other losses that night, he jokes: ""I suffered a heavy defeat and I didn't even get a severance package.""
Politicians do not owe impressionists a living, of course, but their art has become such an established feature of British politics that it would be a shame if a dearth of strong characters on the green Commons benches was to kill it off.
It all began with Peter Cook in Beyond the Fringe. His befuddled take on Harold Macmillan, the patrician grouse moor Tory who told Britons they had ""never had it so good"", was seen as a thrilling challenge to the old, established order at the birth of the ""satire boom"" in the early 1960s. No one had dared to impersonate the prime minister before.
Much to Cook's annoyance, Macmillan sat in the stalls one evening chortling away as his own mannerisms and voice were mercilessly sent-up, prompting the satirist to depart from his script, saying, in Macmillan's pompous tones: ""There's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin spread all over my silly face"".
History does not record whether this wiped the grin off Macmillan's face. But if Cook thought his barbs would stop politicians trying to get in on the joke, he had underestimated the thickness of their hide or their seemingly pathological desire to be seen as a good sport.
Sitting with a silly grin on your face, on a chat show sofa, as a comedian mimics your strange mannerisms is now a rite of passage for Britain's political leaders.
It was Mike Yarwood, with his affectionate but deadly accurate take-offs of characters like Ted Heath, with his heaving shoulders and toothy grin, and Denis Healey, all bushy eyebrows and bluff bonhomie, who brought political impressions to a mainstream television audience. He even furnished Healey with a catchphrase - ""silly Billy"" - which became associated with him in real life.
Yarwood also pioneered the trend for impersonating political journalists - who were (and still are) just as eccentric, or larger than life, as those they interrogate - with his wheezy take on the obstreperous Sir Robin Day.
Rory Bremner took up Yarwood's mantle in the 1990s, although his act owed more to the golden age of political satire than light entertainment. He even recruited two stalwarts of the 1960s scene, John Bird and John Fortune, to add extra bite to his send-ups of Tony Blair's government and the perceived inanity and spin of New Labour.
The one thing all of these impersonators have in common is that they had great material to work with.
The need to look good on television has steadily worn the rough edges off our political leaders. It is not media training - Gordon Brown had plenty of that, but was still a rich seam of vocal and facial tics for the nation's impressionists, more a by-product of the managerialism that has infected the upper reaches of public life.
The tide may be turning, however.
The public's rejection of smooth, identikit politicians - witness the rise of Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump - could yet herald a new golden age for impressionists.
""When Clinton was the president I think he had been impeached before I had mastered his voice,"" says Lewis Macleod, who has got in early with a Trump impersonation.
His Dead Ringers colleague Jan Ravens tells the Westminster Hour she is working on her Hilary Clinton, with her folksy, ""down home"" tones and attempts to come across as a regular ""gramma"".
Rory Bremner says his Jeremy Corbyn is a work in progress - his starting point is the ineffectual, well-meaning warder Barraclough, in classic prison sitcom Porridge.
But the veteran impressionist has developed a fondness for impersonating David Cameron, despite the prime minister's lack of any obvious vocal eccentricities.
And if all fails there is always Boris, or the political broadcasters, to fall back on.","Politicians were not the only ones in shock when the general election exit poll came out, it was also a rude awakening for Britain's impressionists.",35110830

"Fr D'Arcy was responding to a BBC This World programme which found that the cardinal failed to pass details of sex abuse to police or parents.
It said that in 1975, Cardinal Brady had the names and address of children being abused by Fr Brendan Smyth.
Smyth, a paedophile, continued to attack children for a further 13 years.
Cardinal Brady claimed the BBC exaggerated his authority at that time. He said he had ""absolutely no authority over Smyth"" and had felt betrayed that those in the Church who had the power to stop Smyth did not do so.
In an interview with Irish radio station Newstalk on Thursday, Father D'Arcy said he would find it hard to continue if he was in the position of the current Irish Church leader.
But he added that changing the cardinal would not necessarily mean a fresh start.
""The bottom line is that if Cardinal Brady goes, the ordinary  people of Ireland won't have a single vote on who replaces him. That is the problem,"" he said.
""Actually he would have to offer his resignation and if the Vatican didn't take it he would be back to square one.
""Some people think that is what happened two years ago. But the Vatican was saying no.""
Father Eamon Murray, who is originally from Northern Ireland but now based in England, said many priests feel demoralised by clerical child abuse.
He said Cardinal Brady would have do do a ""lot of soul searching"".
""If I was in that position, I would have gone a long time ago because it's your own moral credibility that has suffered,"" he told the BBC's Nolan Show.
""I've listened to a lot of people and naturally people are angry at the church and rightly so and I feel that anger and I feel that hurt and pain.
""It pains me to see people who have practised their faith for a long, long time, many years leaving the church as a result of losing credibility in hierarchy.""
Meanwhile, one of Smyth's victims has called for the cardinal's resignation.
Brendan Boland said he thought Cardinal Brady's refusal to resign was wrong.
""I can't understand why he can't see his failings,"" he said.
""For him to stand without resigning I think that is further abuse of me.
""Resign. Own up to your failings.""
In 1975, Cardinal Brady was a priest and teacher in County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland, when he was sent by his bishop to investigate a claim of child sexual abuse by a fellow priest.
That priest was later exposed as Smyth, who died in prison in 1997, one month into a 12-year prison sentence.
The first child to tell his parents about the abuse was the then 14-year-old Brendan Boland.
Speaking on Wednesday, Cardinal Brady said in a  
          statement
: ""With others, I feel betrayed that those who had the authority in the Church to stop Brendan Smyth failed to act on the evidence I gave them.
""However, I also accept that I was part of an unhelpful culture of deference and silence in society, and the Church, which thankfully is now a thing of the past.""
The cardinal said he was ""shocked, appalled and outraged"" by Smyth and said he had trusted that those with the authority to act in relation to Smyth would treat the evidence seriously and respond appropriately.
""The commentary in the programme and much of the coverage of my role in this inquiry gives the impression that I was the only person who knew of the allegations against Brendan Smyth at that time and that because of the office I hold in the Church today I somehow had the power to stop Brendan Smyth in 1975.
""I had absolutely no authority over Brendan Smyth. Even my Bishop had limited authority over him. The only people who had authority within the Church to stop Brendan Smyth from having contact with children were his Abbot in the Monastery in Kilnacrott and his Religious Superiors in the Norbertine Order.""
Police are also studying the documentary. A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland said: ""The PSNI will study the content of this programme. We can make no further comment at this time.""",Irish priest Father Brian D'Arcy has said he believes Cardinal Sean Brady was willing to offer his resignation two years ago but the Vatican refused.,17931878
"The giant striker was in the right place at the right time to bundle home the loose ball, after Morecambe's defence failed to clear, earning what could be an important draw.
They dropped to 11th, but remain just a point behind Blackpool in the final play-off spot and within two points of sixth-placed Carlisle.
Gareth Ainsworth's side had fallen behind eight minutes earlier when Morecambe veteran Kevin Ellison scored a superb opener.
Ellison received the ball with his back to goal on the edge of the area but turned quickly and curled a delightful effort past Jamal Blackman from the edge of the box.
The first half saw no goals, but plenty of endeavour from both sides.
Blackman was the busier of the two keepers making three excellent saves from three different players.
His best was a flying effort to tip away Michael Rose's 30-yard drive which was heading for the top right-hand corner of the Wycombe goal
The on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper then did well to tip over Paul Mullin's drive and a low volley from Ellison that was destined for the bottom left-hand corner.

"The actress revealed in May last year she had had the surgery, after being told she had an 87% chance of the disease because of a high-risk gene.
The news encouraged women with genuine concerns about their family history to get advice, a study found.
About 5% of breast cancers are thought to be hereditary.
""The Angelina Jolie effect has been long-lasting and global, and appears to have increased referrals to centres appropriately,"" said a team led by ProfÂ Gareth Evans of the University of Manchester.
The researchers looked at referrals to more than 20 genetic centres and clinics in the UK after the story hit the press in May 2013.
In June and July the number of GP referrals for genetic counselling and DNA tests for breast cancer mutations increased two and a half times compared with the same period in 2012.
The study, published in the journal, Breast Cancer Research, found referrals remained at twice the previous year's figure from August to October.
""Angelina Jolie stating she has a BRCA1 mutation and going on to have a risk-reducing mastectomy is likely to have had a bigger impact than other celebrity announcements, possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman,"" said Prof Evans.
""This may have lessened patients' fears about a loss of sexual identity post-preventative surgery and encouraged those who had not previously engaged with health services to consider genetic testing.""
Most breast cancers happen by chance but a small number of people diagnosed with breast cancer (5%) have inherited a fault in one of the known breast cancer genes; BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 which puts them at higher risk.
Angelina Jolie is not alone in influencing health behaviour.
Attendance for cervical cancer screening rose in 2008 and 2009, when the celebrity Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer and died.
Baroness Delyth Morgan is chief executive at Breast Cancer Campaign, which part-funded the research.
""Without Angelina Jolie's openness in talking about her BRCA1 mutation and decision to have a risk-reducing mastectomy, followed by the publication and publicity around the updated NICE guidelines soon after, many women may not have approached health services and so would never have had their risk and risk-reducing options explained,"" she said.
Funding for genetic services must be able to respond quickly to demand, to ensure risk counselling and genetic testing is available for everyone in need, she added.
""The current level of funding available for this service should be reviewed, to avoid unnecessary delays, which can be very stressful for patients.""
Women in general have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime, but genes can put some at higher risk.
In the UK, about one in 1,000 people will have inherited a BRCA1 mutation and a similar proportion will have inherited a BRCA2 mutation.
Women who are tested early can take steps to prevent themselves from developing the disease.
This may mean a risk-reducing mastectomy, cancer preventing drugs, such as tamoxifen, and certain lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and more exercise.
Lester Barr, chairman of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, said: ""While a woman's risk of developing breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she carries the harmful mutation of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, preventative surgery is by no means the answer for everyone.
""Of course, a preventative mastectomy is the most effective way to cut a woman's risk of breast cancer, however other options should also be considered. These include prevention drugs, such as tamoxifen, which has been approved by NICE.
""Alternatively, many women with a mutated BRCA gene opt for annual check-ups which can be arranged through the NHS.""",Referrals to breast cancer clinics more than doubled in the UK after Angelina Jolie announced she had had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer.,29251765

Mr Peres, who was one of the last of a generation of Israeli politicians present at the new nation's birth in 1948, served twice as the country's prime minister and once as president.
He won the Nobel Peace prize in 1994 for his role negotiating peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier.
He once said the Palestinians were Israel's ""closest neighbours"" and might become its ""closest friends"".
Obituary: Shimon Peres, Israeli founding father
Long legacy of Israel's elder statesman
Mr Peres died in a hospital near Tel Aviv early on Wednesday, with his family at his bedside.
He had been in the intensive care unit of the Sheba Medical Centre after suffering a major stroke on 13 September.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his ""deep personal grief on the passing of the beloved of the nation"".
Meanwhile US President Barack Obama called Mr Peres his ""dear friend"" in a statement, and said: ""He was guided by a vision of the human dignity and progress that he knew people of goodwill could advance together.""
Mr Peres shared his Nobel Peace Prize with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
At the start of his long political career, he was put in charge of personnel and arms purchases for the Haganah, the predecessor of the Israel Defense Forces.
He secured a deal with France to supply the new Israeli nation with Mirage jet fighters. He also set up Israel's secret nuclear facility.

"The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond's visit to Tripoli is intended to provide visible international backing for the fledgling Government of National Accord.
He also arrived with further practical assistance; £10m-worth of aid, in part intended to combat people smuggling and terrorism.
Guide to key Libyan militias
Here then is the fundamental driver for Britain's renewed engagement with Libya (and indeed for that of other key European Union partners like France and Italy).
Libya's problems of instability are creating new ungoverned spaces in which so-called Islamic State (IS) is taking root.
The refugee crisis and trafficking of people is compounding the European Union's wider problems as refugees sometimes literally wash up on its shores.
The real question though is why now? Why has a British foreign secretary returned to Tripoli - the first visit since 2011?
And secondly what exactly are the parameters of this relationship, how far will British (and European) support go and to what extent will it have an explicitly military dimension?
The timing is the easiest to answer. The chaos in Libya has spawned two competing governments and a plethora of armed militias.
But the new UN-backed Government of National Accord, which recently set up shop in Tripoli under Fayez Sarraj, is seen as the best, albeit slim, chance of establishing some order in the country.
However, given its origins in the UN process, outside assistance carries a risk - a danger that the new government will not be seen as an outgrowth of Libyan aspirations but as something emanating from outside.
Despite the risks, the new government needs lots of help to put down roots in unpromising terrain.
Britain has been giving aid - and is going to be giving more aid. Funds will go to tackling illegal migration, smuggling and organised crime as well as counter-terrorism.
But what about practical assistance? There are persistent reports that British special forces are on the ground in Libya to counter IS.
Indeed their French counterparts have been far less successful in evading the media spotlight. Their presence was spectacularly ""outed"" by the French newspaper Le Monde back in February.
Special Forces are one thing but regular combat troops quite another. For some time there has been discussion about deploying a 6,000-strong European force to Libya under Italian command.
This would secure the airport in Tripoli and use this as a base to train up the Libyan military.
This proposed mission has drawn strong criticism from the Chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Crispin Blunt, who has warned that such troops could simply become targets for local militias and IS.
The British Government has been less than explicit in responding to Mr Blunt, largely taking refuge in assertions that no decisions have been taken and that no request has yet come from the new Libyan government itself.
Some kind of training may be needed and Britain is likely to play a role. An earlier effort that brought Libyan personnel to Britain ended in controversy when some of the Libyan students were found guilty of rape and other sex attacks.
Indeed their behaviour terrorised the neighbourhood and led to their prompt return to Libya.
But some kind of training assistance will be required, for the police, coastguard, and Libya's military.
The EU is likely to coordinate a significant proportion of this and it's not clear yet how much of this will take place inside Libya or in a neighbouring country - Tunisia for instance.
There could also be pressure on the Libyan government to allow international naval forces to enter Libyan territorial waters to help combat people smuggling. This could give Britain an expanded naval role.
Much will depend upon exactly what the Government of National Accord thinks it needs.
Libya's instability is now though a key threat to southern Europe and beyond.
Thus if the new government can consolidate its position it will be very difficult for the key European military players - like Britain - to refuse assistance.","After playing a leading part in the Western air campaign that helped to oust the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Britain is once again pushing to play a leading role in bringing stability to Libya's shattered society.",36075789
"Simon Marsh, 55, of St Michael and All Angels Church of England church in Bramhall, Stockport, was the subject of an investigation lasting 15 months.
Allegations were made between 2011 to 2013 when the woman was aged 16 to 19.
Mr Marsh had been on bail and was suspended from his parish duties while the investigation took place.
A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: ""Following receipt of a file from Greater Manchester Police, the CPS have conducted a thorough review of the evidence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
""We have reached a decision that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and therefore consider that no further action should be taken in this case.""
A spokesman for the Church of England Diocese of Chester said: ""The Revd Simon Marsh has agreed not to conduct services or be actively engaged in parish ministry in Bramhall for the time being.

"The group carried out a nine-month investigation into the 53,000 images handed to the opposition by a military police photographer, codenamed Caesar.
Researchers interviewed former prisoners, defectors, forensic experts and families of the disappeared.
Syria's government and its allies had questioned the images' authenticity.
They were first published in January 2014 in a report by three former war crimes prosecutors that was commissioned by Qatar, which supports the political and armed opposition in Syria.
In an interview earlier this year, President Bashar al-Assad said: ""You can bring photographs from anyone and say this is torture. There is no verification of any of this evidence, so it's all allegations without evidence.""
But on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch laid out in a new report what it said was new evidence regarding the authenticity of the Caesar photographs, identifying a number of the victims and highlighting some of the key causes of death.
The US-based group said it had located and interviewed 33 relatives and friends of 27 victims whose cases researchers verified; 37 former detainees who saw people die in detention; and four defectors who worked in Syrian government detention centres or the military hospitals where most of the photographs were taken.
Syria torture report
In pictures: Syria accused of torture
Using satellite imagery and geolocation techniques, HRW confirmed that some of the photographs of the dead were taken in the courtyard of the 601 Military Hospital in Mezzeh, a western suburb of the capital Damascus.
The group also identified a coding system for the cards placed on the bodies.
""We have meticulously verified dozens of stories, and we are confident the Caesar photographs present authentic - and damning - evidence of crimes against humanity in Syria,"" said Nadim Houry, HRW's deputy Middle East director.
HRW said its report focused on 28,707 of the 53,275 photos smuggled out of Syria by Caesar that, based on all available information, showed the bodies of at least 6,786 people who died in detention or after being transferred from detention to a military hospital.
The remaining photographs are of attack sites or of bodies identified by name as of government soldiers, other combatants, or civilians killed in attacks, explosions or assassination attempts.
Most of the victims were detained by just five intelligence agency branches in Damascus, and their bodies were sent to at least two military hospitals in Damascus between May 2011, when Caesar began copying files and smuggling them out of his workplace, and August 2013, when he fled Syria, HRW said.
Forensic pathologists from Physicians for Human Rights analysed a subset of the photos, and found evidence of several types of torture, starvation, suffocation, violent blunt force trauma, and in one case, a gunshot wound to the head.
Among the 27 victims identified by HRW - all of whose families spent months or years searching for news of their whereabouts, in many cases paying huge sums to contacts and middlemen - were Rehab al-Allawi, a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest for having an anti-Assad song on his phone, and student Rehab al-Allawi, who was 25 when she was detained while working with an activist group.
The former detainees, held in the same places as most of the victims, told HRW that guards kept them in severely overcrowded cells with very little air circulation, gave them so little food that they grew weak, and often denied them the opportunity to wash. Skin diseases and other infectious diseases proliferated, and the detainees said guards denied them adequate medical care.
""Many of the former detainees who were held in these nightmarish conditions told us they often wished they would die, rather than continue suffering,"" Mr Houry said.
The Syrian Network for Human Rights, an activist group, has documented the arrest and detention of more than 117,000 people in Syria since the uprising against Mr Assad began in March 2011.","Human Rights Watch says it is confident photos smuggled out of Syria by a defector in 2013 showing 6,786 people who died after detention are authentic.",35110877
"The Age UK review said some people could not even wash, dress or feed themselves and yet were being left to fend for themselves by councils.
And the charity warned that the whole system was close to collapse in some areas with services closing.
It comes after the government said it was looking to solve the problems.
Last week, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged action on social care, which covers care homes and help in the home.
That has prompted a growing expectation that a rescue package will be announced in the Budget in early March.
Care is funded by either councils or individuals themselves - although growing numbers are also relying on family and friends to support them.
The Age UK review looked at existing data and concluded there were nearly 1.2 million people who were not now getting the care they need - a rise of 48% since 2010.
This included:
The charity said this had been caused by cuts to council budgets which had led to a rationing of services.
Last year, fewer than half of the people who requested help from councils were given it.

TBC pay for their own care
Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.
As well as reducing the numbers of people they help, councils have also started to squeeze the fees they pay agencies that run care homes and home help services.
A report by market analysts Laing Buission earlier this year that estimated councils were paying £100 less a week than the going rate for a care home place.
The Age UK review said half of councils had seen a care home provider cease trading in their area, while a third had seen a home care agency fold.
Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: ""Our new report makes for frightening reading because it shows just how fragile older people's social care now is.
""We think there is a real risk of collapse in social care in the worst affected areas.""
Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said the review was ""deeply disturbing"".
""Genuine new government money is now the only way to protect the services.""
Councils spent £16bn last year on services for elderly and disabled people. It comes after funding from central government was cut by a third in real terms during the last Parliament.
Councils protected social care by making big cuts elsewhere but still had to reduce the amount they spent on social care by 6%.
Ministers have given councils the ability to ring-fence council tax increases for care services in the coming years and have used NHS money to invest in services, but the LGA predicts by 2020 there will still be a £2.6bn shortfall.
In an interview with the BBC last week, Mr Hunt pledged the government would address the pressures in the social care system.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was not all about money, but added ministers were ""working to find a long-term, sustainable solution"".

"They say the parts, possibly from a Buk surface-to-air system, are ""of particular interest"" and could help show who was behind the crash.
But they say they have not proved their ""causal connection"" with the crash.
MH17 crashed on land held by Russian-backed rebels in July 2014, killing all 298 on board.
There were 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members on the Malaysian Airlines airliner.
About two-thirds of those who died were Dutch nationals, with dozens of Malaysians and Australians among the rest.
Ukraine and many Western countries have accused pro-Russian rebels of shooting down the plane, saying they could have used a Buk missile system supplied by Russia.
Russia and the rebels deny any responsibility and say the Ukrainian military was to blame.
How a missile could have brought down MH17
MH17: What we know
A tale of two sisters and flight MH17
Air disaster that touched a nation
The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) said in a joint statement with the Dutch Safety Board that the parts had been ""secured during a previous recovery mission in eastern Ukraine"".
""The parts are of particular interest to the criminal investigation as they can possibly provide more information about who was involved in the crash of MH17. For that reason the JIT further investigates the origin of these parts,"" the statement said.
Fred Westerbeke, a spokesman for the Dutch Prosecutor's Office, said that seven fragments had been found which were definitely not part of the aircraft, and further investigations had shown that they were probably from a missile system.
""We are going to need more investigation to really find out what exactly this is and if it is part of a possible system that took down MH17,"" he added.
""If we can establish that, then we can say that it is a breakthrough.""
The Dutch safety board is characteristically cautious. For now it is insisting that no causal connection can be established between the discovered parts and the crash.
The aircraft is widely believed to have been downed by a surface-to-air missile. Indeed the investigators' preliminary report - released last September - noted that the damage to the aircraft's fuselage and cockpit indicated impacts from a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft; consistent with an engagement by a Buk-type missile.
The crucial question remains who fired the weapon - Russian-backed separatists or even the Russian military itself? The Ukrainians also operate a variant of the Buk system.
The missile parts could be a help here but satellite intelligence may provide more of the picture. Independent investigators have already established a video trail which appears to place a Buk launcher in the crash area on the day in question.
The investigators would now enlist the help of weapons experts and forensic specialists to examine the parts, the statement added.
The JIT comprises representatives of the Netherlands, Ukraine, Belgium, Malaysia and Australia.
They are meeting in The Hague to discuss a draft report on the causes of the crash, the final version of which is expected to be published by the Dutch Safety Board in October.
The statement comes two weeks after Russia vetoed a draft resolution to set up an international tribunal into the disaster, triggering widespread outrage.
Moscow described the Malaysian initiative as ""premature"" and ""counterproductive"".

"The Commons' Home Affairs Committee said the UK Border Agency should challenge unacceptable behaviour by some of its contractors.
The report comes 15 months after a deportee died on a flight.
A spokesman for the UKBA said that all private security escorts are trained in approved restraint techniques.
Jimmy Mubenga, 46, fell ill and collapsed on a British Airways plane bound for Angola on 12 October 2010.
The MPs did not comment on the case, which is still being investigated by the police, but said that Mr Mubenga's death had triggered their own investigations into the way that the UK Border Agency managed the deportation of people on flights from the UK.
The UKBA contracts out the job of escorting people to their deportation flight. The contract has been held by Reliance since May 2011 and previously by G4S.
The MPs said found:
""It is a matter for serious concern that contractors should use racist language among themselves,"" said the report.
""That they were content to do so in front of not only UK Border Agency staff but also inspectors from HM Inspectorate of Prisons is shocking. It is possibly the result of a relationship between the Agency and its contractors which had become too cosy.""
Restraint techniques
The MPs said that the UKBA's own staff should feel that they can properly challenge any bad behaviour by contractors - but it also criticised the practice of taking ""reserves"" to airports - people who may then find that they are not being removed from the UK after all.
It called on the government to allow independent monitors, people allowed into prisons and removal centres, to board removal flights.
The MPs said that they were not convinced that a potentially harmful head-down restraint position was never used, even though it was not authorised.
A recent expert report found that such techniques could lead to death.
""We recommend that the Home Office issue urgent guidance to all staff involved in enforced removals about the danger of seated restraint techniques in which the subject is bent forwards.
""We also recommend that the Home Office commission research into control and restraint techniques which are suitable for use on an aircraft. The use by contractors of unauthorised restraint techniques, sanctioning their use, or failing to challenge their use, should be grounds for dismissal.""
Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: ""The UK Border Agency must not wash its hands of responsibility for detainees just because the service is contracted out.
""People who are not entitled to remain in the country must be removed and there may be occasions when it is necessary to use physical force, but this must always be done only when absolutely necessary, and with proper respect for the dignity of the detainee.""
A UKBA spokesman said: ""All escorts on flights are trained to use restraint techniques approved by the Prison Service.
""We have no evidence contractors use head-down restraints and would take strong action against them if their conduct does not meet our standards.

"Charlie Austin put the home side ahead with a penalty after Shane Long was fouled by Martin Kelly's challenge.
Saints deservedly doubled their lead through midfielder Jake Hesketh's first goal for the club just after the hour.
Connor Wickham had Palace's best chance but failed to latch on to a loose back header from Jose Fonte inside the box.
Austin's fourth goal in the space of six days and three games gave Claude Puel's Southampton a deserved lead after half an hour.
Palace lost captain Scott Dann early on to a suspected hamstring injury and it was his replacement Kelly who was at fault in the build-up to the opening goal.
The central defender failed to control the ball with his chest and as it ran away from him Long gave chase and was tripped inside the box.
Long almost netted a goal of his own in the closing stages of the first half when he rounded Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, but his finish lacked power and allowed Damien Delaney to clear off the line.
Saints' continued pressure in the second half finally told as they doubled their lead through 20-year-old Hesketh.
Long drove into the box and when his shot was saved by Hennessey the rebound broke to Hesketh, who calmly swept a left-footed finish into the bottom corner.
Southampton midfielder Jake Hesketh told BBC Radio Solent:
""First and foremost we're through in the cup, but to score a (first senior) goal was perfect for me.
""It's a bit of a whirlwind really. It's come back to me nicely and then I've just run off.
""In my head I'm thinking, 'what am I doing here?' as I wasn't sure whether or not to celebrate with a knee-slide. But, it was brilliant.
""It's really nice and you feel really appreciated by the fans and to get a goal for them, I'm really happy.
""Training with the lads day-in, day-out is really beneficial. You try to take everything on board and take it into situations like tonight.""

""Shane Long is quick and has got a bit of history in those situations. He was definitely going over, I know that, but the video I saw was inconclusive.
""The players felt it (the penalty) was a bit harsh but it was difficult to see unless you see it clearly on television.
""The best team won for sure. They were very sharp. Their passing and movement caused us problems.
""It is always a risk when you make a lot of changes and we had one or two players that looked a bit rusty. We didn't have enough imagination to find a route to goal.""

Eventually, they believe using AI could revolutionise healthcare by turning anyone's smartphone into a cancer scanner.
Cancer Research UK said it could become a useful tool for doctors.
The AI was repurposed from software developed by Google that had learned to spot the difference between images of cats and dogs.
It was shown 129,450 photographs and told what type of skin condition it was looking at in each one.
It then learned to spot the hallmarks of the most common type of skin cancer: carcinoma, and the most deadly: melanoma.
Only one in 20 skin cancers are melanoma, yet the tumour accounts for three-quarters of skin cancer deaths.
The experiment, detailed in the journal Nature, then tested the AI against 21 trained skin cancer doctors.
One of the researchers, Dr Andre Esteva, told the BBC News website: ""We find, in general, that we are on par with board-certified dermatologists.""
However, the computer software cannot make a full diagnosis, as this is normally confirmed with a tissue biopsy.
Dr Esteva said the system now needed to be tested alongside doctors in the clinic.
""The application of AI to healthcare is, we believe, an incredibly exciting area of research that can be leveraged to achieve a great deal of societal good,"" he said.
""One particular route that we find exciting is the use of this algorithm on a mobile device, but to achieve this we would have to build an app and test its accuracy directly from a mobile device.""
Incredible advances in machine-learning have already led to AI beating one of humanity's best Go players.
And a team of doctors in London have trained AI to predict when the heart will fail.
Dr Jana Witt, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said:  ""Using artificial intelligence to help diagnose skin cancer is very interesting, as it could support assessments by GPs and dermatologists.
""It's unlikely that AI will replace all of the other information your clinician would consider when making a diagnosis, but AI could help guide GP referrals to specialists in the future.""

"The alleged spying by the National Security Agency (NSA) ""must be explained and more importantly new trust must be built up for the future"", she told German MPs.
The allegations dominated the news during an EU summit last month.
Ms Merkel said the NSA affair was putting EU-US trade talks to the test.
She also said Germany's relations with the US ""are of paramount importance"".
The German government has said it is keen to hear directly from the fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden about the agency's collection of phone and internet data.
But Germany says it cannot offer him asylum because he would have to make his application on German soil.
According to his leaks, the NSA targeted communications among Washington's Western allies, including Ms Merkel's mobile phone and EU offices.
""The accusations are grave,"" Ms Merkel said in her statement on Monday. She did not comment specifically on the alleged bugging of her phone.
The Bundestag - Germany's lower house - is holding a special debate on the NSA spying allegations.
The scale of NSA surveillance in Germany is not clear, and last month Germany sent some senior officials to Washington to find out more.

"The study in Scientific Reports suggests every hour spent using a touchscreen each day was linked to 15 minutes less sleep.
However, those playing with touchscreens do develop their fine motor skills more quickly.
Experts said the study was ""timely"" but parents should not lose sleep over it.
There has been an explosion in touchscreens in the home, but understanding their impact on early childhood development has been lacking.
The study by Birkbeck, University of London, questioned 715 parents of children under three years old.
It asked how often their child played with a smartphone or tablet and about the child's sleep patterns.
It showed that 75% of the toddlers used a touchscreen on a daily basis, with 51% of those between six and 11 months using one, and 92% of those between 25 and 36 months doing so as well.
But children who did play with touchscreens slept less at night and more in the day.
Overall they had around 15 minutes less sleep for every hour of touchscreen use.
Dr Tim Smith, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""It isn't a massive amount when you're sleeping 10-12 hours a day in total, but every minute matters in young development because of the benefits of sleep.""
The study is not definitive, but Dr Smith says it ""seems to indicate touchscreens have some association with possible sleep problems"".
However, his research has also shown toddlers who actively use touchscreens (swiping rather than watching) accelerate their development of motor skills.
So should children be given touchscreens to play with?
Dr Smith says: ""It's very tricky right now, the science is very immature, we are really lagging behind the technology and it's too early to make clear proclamations.""
He says the best bet is to follow similar rules for the amount of time spent in front of the TV.
That means putting a limit on the total time spent on devices, ensuring children still do physical things, ensuring that content is age-appropriate, and avoiding the screens in the hour before bedtime.
Dr Anna Joyce, a cognitive developmental researcher at Coventry University, said: ""As the first study to investigate associations between sleep and touchscreen use in infancy, this is a timely piece of research.
""In light of these findings and what we know from previous research it may be worth parents limiting touchscreen, other media use and blue light in the hours before bedtime.
""Until we know more about how touchscreens affect sleep, they shouldn't be banned completely,"" she added.
Prof Kevin McConway, from The Open University, said: ""I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over these results, if I still had young children.
""The children in this study used a touchscreen for about 25 minutes a day, a child who used a touchscreen for this average length of time would sleep for about 6 minutes less.""

"On Thursday, the firm acknowledged it read the anonymous blogger's emails in order to identify an employee it suspected of leaking information.
Microsoft owns Hotmail, a free email service now called Outlook.com.
John Frank, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said it took ""extraordinary actions in this case"".
While the search was technically legal, he added Microsoft would consult outside counsel in the future.
Microsoft's actions came to light this week as part of a legal case by US prosecutors against an ex-Microsoft employee, Alex Kibalko, who was a Russian native based in the company's Lebanon office.
In 2012, Microsoft had been alerted to the fact that the blogger, whose identity was kept anonymous in the court papers, had been given some stolen lines of code from the not-yet-released Windows 8 operating system.
The blogger then posted screenshots of the unreleased Windows operating system to his blog.
To figure out the source of the leak, Microsoft began an investigation and, as part of that search, looked into the blogger's accounts to find out the name of the employee.
The search was legal because it fell within Microsoft's terms of service which state that the company can access information in accounts that are stored on its ""Communication Services"", which includes email, chat areas, forums, and other communication facilities.
The terms of service add: ""Microsoft reserves the right to review materials posted to the Communication Services and to remove any materials in its sole discretion.""

"Labour called health policy, which is devolved to Welsh ministers, a ""real dividing line"" between it and the Conservative Party.
Labour said it would use funds from a tax on expensive UK homes for 1,000 extra medical staff in the Welsh NHS.
But the Conservatives said Wales was the only part of the UK where health spending had been cut.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""Ed Miliband has no plan to grow our economy - that's why he will put the future of our NHS at risk, just as Labour have done in Wales.""
Labour Welsh government Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""The NHS is a real dividing line between Labour and the Tories this May.
""With Labour you get additional funding, more frontline staff and a promise that we'll never privatise our health service.
""The Tories are staying quiet because they've already begun the privatisation agenda in England, and they know that it's something they can use to tempt Nigel Farage into a post-election deal.""
Despite being a devolved issue, the NHS has featured prominently in the election campaign so far.
Earlier this week, Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said voters were not interested in whether the service was run from Cardiff or Westminster.
Darren Millar, the Conservative shadow health minister in the assembly, said: ""Ed Miliband has held Wales up as an example of what he'd do and the facts speak for themselves - longer waiting times for tests and treatment, poorer ambulance service performance and higher hospital death rates.
""The truth is that Welsh Conservatives are the only political party consistently voting against cutting the health budget in Wales.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Cardiff Central, Jenny Willott, said Conservative spending plans would damage vital public services.
""The Tories still haven't said where they would find the money the NHS needs, unlike the Lib Dems. With their plans to cut and keeping cutting the budget throughout the next five years, they will have to take the money from other areas, damaging our precious public services.
""Unless and until the Conservatives show how they plan to pay for their promises, the Liberal Democrats will remain the only party to make a real, credible commitment to funding the NHS.
""The Liberal Democrats are the only party who has committed to giving the NHS the Â£8bn it needs, which means millions of pounds extra for Wales' health service, and we have set out how we will pay for it.""
Plaid Cymru candidate for Arfon, Hywel Williams, said the Westminster parties had used health as a political football for too long.
""This is doing nothing for the morale of hard-working staff and the patients who rely on our Welsh health service,"" he said.
""Plaid Cymru is interested in solutions. We have unveiled detailed, costed proposals to train and recruit an additional 1,000 doctors in Wales, and outlined plans to integrate health and social care to address the growing problem of bed-blocking.""

All existing paper Bank of Scotland £5 notes will be gradually withdrawn.
However, those that remain in circulation will continue to be accepted at shops, banks and cash payment machines.

Polymer banknotes are made from a very thin, flexible, see-through plastic film, with the design printed on special layers of ink on the front and back.
Because the main material is see-through, the design can include clear spots that are like little windows you can look straight through.

"Gunners Joseph Rowbottom, 27, from Wrawby, North Lincolnshire, and Albert Venus, 22, from Hull, died on 24 May 1915 during the Second Battle of Ypres.
Their remains were found during work on a new housing estate.
Relatives attended Ypres Town Cemetery where their bodies were reinterred, in coffins draped with the union jack.
The soldiers' remains, with shoulder titles from the North and East Riding Batteries of the RFA, were uncovered in the town in April 2013.
Ministry of Defence (MoD) researchers were only able to identify the two men of the six found.
Gunner Venus's great nephew John Howden, 73, from Roos, East Yorkshire, was handed the folded union jack that had draped his coffin.
He said: ""When they handed me the flag I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes and I did not think it would affect me that way.
""You are at a distance and all of a sudden you're involved and it's near, it's just emotional.""
Mr Howden said he had not known about his great uncle until he got a letter from the MoD.
He said he was pleased the link was proved following a DNA test.

"But the news so far has been bigger - and worse - than they can possibly have imagined.
The US investigation into corruption at the highest levels of the world's most popular game will have far-reaching implications for how the game is run - and who runs it.
As news of arrests at the top of Fifa began to sink in, the organisation said it was planning to go ahead as scheduled with the election of its president - which was expected to result once again in a kind of coronation for Sepp Blatter, the great survivor of world sports administration.
But there's another item on the agenda too - one that may still be troubling delegates far into the future when Mr Blatter is eventually gone and the corruption story has played itself out.
The Palestinian delegation wants Fifa to suspend Israel from world football.
This is not just about sport of course.
The Palestinians are pursuing a strategy they call ""internationalisation"" - which means bringing their grievances against Israel into as many international arenas as possible. And arenas don't come any bigger than Fifa.
The issue has been raised in previous years but some sort of deal was worked out to prevent the issue from coming to a vote.
This time the head of the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), Jibril Rajoub, says nothing will persuade him to remove the request from Fifa's formal agenda. There won't be any backroom deals - there will be a vote.
""I am going to end the suffering and the humiliation of the Palestinian footballers,"" he told me. ""It is our right.""
The Palestinians believe their case is strong.
They complain about how police and army checkpoints which restrict freedom of movement around the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank hamper the ability of players and officials to get to games.
The point is illustrated in a video presentation in which a middle-aged Palestinian called Farouq Assi is captured on the cameras of a human rights activist blindfolded, handcuffed and in custody at an Israeli checkpoint in the West Bank.
It's not a rare event. It's in the presentation because Mr Assi is a football referee and he was on his way to take charge of a game in Jericho when he was detained. The match was abandoned.
Palestinian territory is divided into two parts - Gaza and the West Bank. Israel controls all movement into and out of the West Bank through a series of checkpoints and it maintains strict controls at its crossing with Gaza through which players and officials have to travel to play West Bank teams.
Israeli sports officials argue they have no control over the policies applied at those checkpoints by Israeli security and intelligence agencies.
Mr Blatter made a trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories ahead of the Fifa Congress in what appears to have been a failed attempt to stop the issue from being pushed to a vote.
Not long after he left an incident at an Israeli-controlled border crossing with Jordan illustrated the problem.
The Palestinian national team was leaving through the checkpoint on its way to play an overseas fixture - it flies through Amman in Jordan, a short drive across the desert rather than from Israel's main airport in Tel Aviv.
As they were leaving there were reports that one of their players, Sameh Maarabe, had been arrested by Israeli officials.
Israel explained later that Maarabe had been convicted last year of using an overseas trip to smuggle money and messages back into the West Bank on behalf of the militant group Hamas.
To Palestinians that's a story about the harassment of a footballer - to Israelis it's about issuing a warning about re-offending to someone who has a criminal record and who happens to be a footballer.
There are other grievances too - including the presence on Occupied Palestinian Territory of teams from Jewish settlements which are allowed to play in the Israeli league.
But Israel feels it has a positive story to tell about sport.
There are Arab players in the Israeli national team and at most top-flight clubs - although there is an exception in that Beitar Jerusalem has often attracted criticism for the racism of its nationalist fans.
Former English Premier League star Yossi Benayoun, who's arguably Israel's best-ever player, told me: ""Sport is one of the only things that brings people together. In my experience I played with Muslims, Christians and any other religion and it's the same in Israel - during my time in the national team we always played with Arab players and it was the same for them.
""I hope it doesn't come to this decision, because it's nothing to do with sport.""
For now the Israeli sports authorities have left their argument at that, but not everyone in Israel has been so diplomatic.
The well-connected Israeli legal campaign group Shurat HaDin, for example, has drawn attention to Jibril Rajoub's membership of the central committee of the Fatah movement, which has an armed wing.
It has found several militaristic quotes from Mr Rajoub talking about the Palestinian conflict with Israel and has written to Fifa demanding that he should be expelled, instead of the Israel Football Association (IFA).
Their letter is an illustration of the fear inside football that giving in to one expulsion request is bound to trigger others - what if Ukraine should demand the suspension of Russia over the annexation of Crimea for example, when the Russians are scheduled to host the next World Cup?
Within the world of sport there's always a tendency to keep difficult issues at bay by arguing that sport and politics don't mix - but of course in extreme cases they do.
Both apartheid-era South Africa and the now-vanished Yugoslavia led by Slobodan Milosevic were expelled from international bodies - the Palestinian chances of success at Fifa will depend on persuading enough delegates that their case matches those precedents.
Israel for now seems confident - partly because Sepp Blatter has clarified that the rules for suspension require a 75% majority, and partly because, in the words of the Israeli expert on international law Alan Baker, this is ""a familiar grievance in a new forum"".
The dramatic arrests which overshadowed the start of the Fifa Congress may have shifted the spotlight from the Palestinian case for now but this is an issue that won't go away.

 said reforms were Greece's ""best guarantee"" to overcome tough economic and social challenges.
European markets were mixed in morning trading, after Asia had recorded earlier gains.
The Syriza party, which rejected the bailout terms and came a close second, said it would lead the opposition.
With 99.9% of ballots counted, interior ministry results put New Democracy on 29.7% of the vote (129 seats), Syriza on 26.9% (71) and the socialist Pasok on 12.3% (33).
There are 300 seats in parliament and Greece has a rule that gives the leading party 50 extra seats.
Greek voters had gone to the polls on Sunday following inconclusive elections in May.
New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said Greeks had chosen to stay in the euro and called for a ""national salvation government"".
By Gavin HewittEurope editor
If Antonis Samaras is confirmed in power he will have a stronger opposition breathing down his neck. He will say to Europe that he has anchored Greece in the eurozone and wants something in return. That will be difficult.
Already German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle has come out and said that the substance of the Greek reform bailout programme is non-negotiable. Where there might be some flexibility is over the timing of the implementation of reforms. There may also be some movement over interest rates on the loans and the EU might offer Greece some funds to boost growth.
But the message is clear; the austerity programme with its budget and spending cuts will stay.  The German finance minister underlined that message when he said: ""Greece's path will be neither short nor easy"".
He is now meeting President Carolos Papoulias, who is expected to give him the mandate to try to form a government.
Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipras said his party would not take part in the government, and would instead become a powerful anti-austerity voice in the opposition.
The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says Mr Samaras is expected to try for a broad coalition, hoping to create a stable government with a stronger popular mandate.
He says Mr Samaras will push for a lightening of the bailout terms from Brussels, arguing that Greeks have accepted more pain by electing a pro-bailout party and that Europe should now cut Greece some slack.
However, correspondents also point out that only 40% of voters backed parties that broadly support the bail-out deal with the EU and the IMF.
Tough austerity measures were attached to the two international bailouts awarded to Greece, an initial package worth 110bn euros (Â£89bn; $138bn) in 2010, then a follow-up last year worth 130bn euros.
Sunday's vote was watched around the world, amid fears that a Greek exit from the euro could spread contagion to other eurozone members and deepen the turmoil in the global economy.
European stock markets were mixed in morning trading. Asian shares had earlier advanced. Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi both closed up 1.8%.
BBC business editor Robert Peston says the election results have been seen by investors as avoiding the worst short-term outcome, which would have been political paralysis followed by a messy exit from the euro.
In a statement on behalf of the 17 eurozone finance ministers, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Paul Juncker said that ""continued fiscal and structural reforms are Greece's best guarantee to overcome the current economic and social challenges and for a more prosperous future of Greece in the euro area"".

In  
          a joint statement
 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also hailed the result, and expressed hope that a government would be formed quickly.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel telephoned Mr Samaras to congratulate him on his victory.
A German government statement said she had ""stated that she would work on the basis that Greece will meet its European commitments"".
The US stressed that it was in everyone's interests ""for Greece to remain in the euro area"".
Mr Samaras said that the Greek people had voted to stay in the eurozone.
""There is no time to waste,"" he said. ""A national salvation government must bring economic growth and reassure Greeks the worst is over.""
He added: ""There will be no more adventures. Greece's place in Europe will not be put in doubt,"" promising that Athens would ""honour its obligations"".
Our correspondent, Mark Lowen, says this suggests that Mr Samaras wants to press ahead with spending cuts demanded by the country's international creditors.
European leaders have warned that if the new Greek government rejects the bailout, the country could be forced to abandon the single currency.
New Democracy should be able to build a majority coalition with the socialist Pasok.
However, coalition talks may not be easy.
In addition to Syriza's showing, four other parties which oppose or want a radical overhaul of the bailout look set to take between 60 and 70 seats. They include the far-right Golden Dawn, which has about 7% of the vote.

"The Gaia satellite will be sent far from Earth to map the positions of more than a billion stars in our galaxy.
Remarkable sensitivity should also enable the observatory to see hundreds of thousands of new celestial objects, including previously unknown planets.
The main structure of the spacecraft was moved this week from the UK factory where it has been for a year to undergo tests on its propulsion system.
EADS Astrium in Stevenage transported Gaia by road to Ampac-ISP at Aylesbury for checks on its cold gas micro-thrusters.  Once this work is complete, the structure will then go to Astrium's Toulouse, France, facility for final preparations.
The European Space Agency (Esa) satellite is due for launch in 2012 on a Soyuz rocket from the new Sinnamary spaceport in French Guiana.
Gaia is a successor to Europe's Hipparcos space astrometry mission which ran in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It catalogued more than 100,000 stars in our galaxy.
The new mission is a step change in capability, however.  Its billion-pixel camera system will give scientists an unprecedented 3D map of the sky.
Over a five-year period, it will chart the precise positions, distances, movements, luminosities, and changes in brightness of stars.  These details will unlock new information about the structure, origin and evolution of our Milky Way Galaxy.
And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its field of vision, it is likely also to see countless objects that had hitherto gone unrecorded - such as asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, and tepid stars that never quite fired into life.
What you see in the image at the top of this page is Gaia's electrical and service module.
This is the part of the satellite that will do all of the ""housekeeping"" in space. It contains elements such as the attitude and orbit control system, the avionics, the computer and data handling subsystems. A large antenna will go underneath the structure to allow Gaia to talk to Earth.
What you do not see here is the payload module that will eventually go on top.  This will be the unit that contains Gaia's telescopes and camera system.
Nor do you see the thermal shield which will open - petal-like - from the underside of the service module to give protection to Gaia's sensitive optics.
""Gaia came to Stevenage about a year ago as a bare structure,"" said the Astrium UK Gaia project manager, Andy Whitehouse.
""Since then we've integrated the propulsion system.  We've built all of that offline and then put it on the structure.  There's a lot of pipework that runs around inside, and the tanks are also inside as well.""
Mark Tomlin, the assembly and integration test manager, added: ""There wasn't much time to bring all this together.  We've done almost 500 welds on the mechanical service module and that's taken us on the order of six months to achieve.  It's been a monumental task.  Each weld has to be X-rayed and cleaned.""
As a lead member state of the European Space Agency, the UK is playing a prominent role on the mission, both scientifically and industrially.
The immense array of camera detectors, or CCDs (charge-coupled devices), is being provided by e2v at Chelmsford.
""The bulk of the work going on here at Astrium UK is on the electrical side, not the mechanical side,"" observed Dr Ralph Cordey, the company's head of science.
""This includes the crucial onboard processing units, which turn the prodigious amounts of data Gaia will get from its CCDs into a data stream that can be sent to Earth.""

"The head of city centre regeneration is set to receive the largest increase of 20%, leading to a salary of £75,000.
A council document said it reflected ""increased responsibility"" due to ""additional city centre development"".
But, the Taxpayers' Alliance said people wanted to see lower council tax rates, not large pay rises for bosses.
Councillor John Flanagan said the rises affected eight posts and would be funded ""from within existing budgets"".
Seven other senior bosses could earn a pay rise of about 7%.
Despite the disappointing performance of Manchester's schools over recent years, the strategic director of education and skills will get a pay rise of 7.6%.
That will take their new salary to £125,000 per year.
As for other council staff, there are around 1,300 employees who are paid the living wage of £8.25 per hour - and the average council salary is £23,000 a year.
In addition to that, most city council employees were given a pay rise of just 1% earlier this year.
The council have had to cope with huge cuts worth around £300m a year over the past six years.
That has meant a reduction in staff from around 10,000 - to fewer than 6,000 today.
Mr Flanagan, executive member for finance, said: ""It is essential that we can keep and attract the right calibre of senior staff by having salaries which reflect the levels of responsibility they have and are in line with those available in comparable cities.
""We are currently reviewing all staff salaries, from top to bottom, to ensure they fairly reflect their workloads and responsibility, while maintaining value for money for council taxpayers.""
Harry Davis, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the council had been ""really good over the last half decade"" over pay issues.
""They have removed about 400 staff earning over £50,000,"" he said.
""But, when savings need to be made and council tax is still going up, they have to make sure that they keep a tight grip on the purse strings so that they can channel as much as possible to front line services and tax cuts for local residents.""",Senior managers at Manchester City Council could receive above-inflationary pay rises if plans are approved on Thursday.,36946380
"After the ignominious fall of Presidents Ben Ali in Tunisia and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, it was widely noted that these events disproved the 'Arab exception' - the belief, held in the face of mountains of contradictory evidence, that Arabs did not want democracy.
But the overwhelming focus on the ""demand-side"" of an uprising lost sight of something more important: that the ""market for revolution"" cannot clear if the army is both able and willing to use overwhelming force. In other words, armies control the ""supply-side"" of revolution.
History is replete with abortive awakenings, in which the supply constraint has choked off change: Europe 1848, Hungary 1956, Prague 1968, Beijing 1989, and - what may turn into the tragic footnote to the Arab Spring - Bahrain 2011. Syria could be appended to that list in short order.
This is about much more than raw coercive capacity. Both South Korea's army in 1987 and Egypt's this year could have put up stiff resistance to the movements that swept away incumbent dictators. Why did they hold their fire?
The answer lies in civil-military dynamics. Armies that have their own identity, that possess a corporate existence separate from their political masters, often choose to manage political transition rather than simply squelch it. They see a future beyond the regime.
In Turkey, Pakistan, and now Egypt, the army has judged that it can enjoy its economic and political privileges by controlling the scope and direction of change.
In fact, outright repression would tarnish the invaluable national credentials each institution enjoys, largely as a result of its own myth-making and manipulation.
Egypt's army did try to dislodge the masses in Tahrir Square. But when it realised it could not do so without enormous bloodshed that would also wash away the institution's veneer, it shied away.
On the other hand, armies that are little more than outgrowths of an autocratic regime know that they have no institutional future if protesters get their way.
In Syria, 70% of career soldiers and 80% of officers are drawn from the ruling minority Alawite clan. Those units employed in crackdowns and massacres, such as the Fourth Division controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's brother, are all-Alawite, as are key intelligence organisations and militias.
These armies - like Bahrain's security forces and Libya's elite brigades - may be disciplined and cohesive, but they are not professional. Since their fate is bound up with that of the regimes, they have little compunction in unleashing violence.
It is this distinction, between independent and servile armies, that is one of the most important parameters in determining the trajectory of an uprising.
An independent, professional army, no matter how powerful, will have appealing alternatives to bloodshed. That doesn't guarantee a democratic revolution - see the sorry paths of 1980s Turkey or 1990s Pakistan - but it does enable a change.
Armies with a distinct corporate identity can produce dangerous Praetorian states - where the military exercises undue influence over the political regime - but they can also enable peaceful transitions.
For those armies that opt for violence, capacity does matter. The archetypal case remains Tiananmen Square. Even though 3,500 PLA officers disobeyed orders in 1989, this was only a fraction of the overall total used in the crackdown.
It helped that the PLA's 27th Army was at the forefront; this unit's troops were from northern Shaanxi Province, speaking a different dialect to the student protesters.
Bahrain learnt this lesson well, and spent years importing Sunni mercenaries from Pakistan. They have proved to be ready to fire on Shia protesters.
The Iraqi army, a mostly Sunni force, had similarly little compunction about brutally putting down the 1991 uprising in Shia and Kurdish parts of the country.
In Syria, the Assad regime cynically uses Christian and Druze troops against Sunni targets.
The UAE has gone a step further, reportedly hiring Blackwater founder Erik Prince to help establish an all-mercenary force of about 800 foreign fighters.
Ethnic difference matters.
Nonetheless, most armies do not enjoy the Tiananmen option. A weak army, or one where only select units are equipped and led by regime loyalists, will quickly disintegrate into patchwork militias.
In Libya, eastern units peeled away from Gaddafi at the outset of the conflict, sowing the seeds of a civil war. What could have been another Hama - the 1982 massacre perpetrated by an earlier incarnation of the Assad regime in Syria - became something much less simple.
All of this is not to neglect the demand-side of revolution. After all, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have all been largely quiet, and not just because of fear.
But with the understandable romanticisation of raw protest, we lose sight of the fact that massed crowds are but one ingredient of successful regime change.
For those peering into these restive states, this is a reminder that capacity-building in the absence of professionalisation simply produces more efficient slaughter.
Britain trained and equipped some of the Libyan special forces who inflicted such horrors on cities like Misrata. Western states continue to train Saudi forces, and this may well have much the same effect.
For those that find this improbable, consider that six months ago Bahrain was considered a humane and liberalising country whose parliamentary institutions obviated the need for a crackdown.
The more immediate lessons may be these: parts of Yemen's splintered forces have proven flexible enough to manoeuvre away from the Saleh regime, and might yet fall in line behind a transitional government that emerges.
Syria's sectarian army, on the other hand, will not go down without a fierce fight - one that they have an excellent chance of winning.

"The dairies operation, which processes and distributes milk, is being sold to Germany's Mueller for Â£80m.
It comes as profits at the UK's largest dairy food company fell 95% to Â£900,000 in the six months to September.
Dairy Crest processes and delivers around 1.3 billion litres of milk a year for retailers and homes.
Dairy Crest said in a statement that the deal was in the best interests of consumers, customers and dairy farmers.
The dairies business accounts for about 70% of the company's revenues, which rose 1% to Â£682.1m during the six months.
After the sale, which still needs shareholder approval and could take several months, Dairy Crest will focus on its profitable cheese and spreads operations.
There are about 14,000 dairy farmers in the UK, producing 3.3 million litres a day. However, with milk prices having fallen, there has been much debate about whether the economics of the industry are sustainable.
Investors approved of the Dairy Crest's decision to get out of a loss-making sector, sending its shares 10% higher in morning trading on Thursday.
Muller said the deal would lead to lower costs and larger exports of dairy products made in the UK.
Ronald Kers, chief executive of Muller UK & Ireland, said: ""We are concerned that the dynamics of the UK fresh milk market are unsustainable for dairy processors in the mid to long term and this acquisition will allow us to reduce our costs, increase our efficiencies and invest in the future.""
Under the deal, Mueller's UK division - Muller Wiseman Dairies - will take over factories at Foston, in Derbyshire, Chadwell Heath, in Essex, and Severnside, near Gloucester.

"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country.
The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth.
The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China.
They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago.
Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell.
Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record.
""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of  natural resources that were available in the immediate environment.""
These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said.
""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places.""
The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century.
However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"".
""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added.
""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.""
The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons.
Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.
""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

"It was the famous Fairfield yard which took the Upper Clyde to great heights and worldwide prominence.
The yard was founded in 1864 by William Elder, a talented marine engineer who developed the compound engine which transformed shipbuilding by allowing vessels to use fuel more efficiently and travel further.
Under William Pearce from 1888, the company flourished, building luxurious ocean liners, steamers and naval ships for the world.
At its peak before World War 1, the Fairfield shipyard was part of a local industry which directly employed 70,000 workers in 19 yards.
The largest crane in the world, with a maximum lift capacity of 250 tons, was built at the Govan yard in 1911 and in the following year Fairfield had 12 ships under construction at the same time.
The inter-war years saw a gradual decline but Clydeside's largest shipyard still built many famous ships and during wartime it was a major builder for the Royal Navy.
But after World War 2, the decline set in swiftly and despite a major modernisation programme in the 1950s the yards of the Clyde were unable to compete with new shipbuilding superpowers such as Japan.
By 1967 the receivers were called in and it looked as if the end had come for Fairfield and for shipbuilding in Govan.
Sean Connery, at the height of his James Bond fame, made a documentary about problems besetting the yard, entitled The Bowler and the Bunnet.
Among the footage of a community on the edge of oblivion was Connery riding a bicycle around empty shipyard fabrication sheds.
The UK government's response to the crisis was to create the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) in 1968, which had about 8,500 workers in five yards - Fairfield's and Stephens on the south bank, Connel's and Yarrow's on the north bank, and John Brown's at Clydebank.
In 1971 UCS went into receivership and was refused a government loan. This led to one of the most famous episodes in industrial history - the work-in.
The unions, led by Jimmy Reid and Jimmy Airlie, occupied the yard and made a demand of the then Conservative prime minister Edward Heath for the ""right to work"".
In February 1972, the government agreed to retain two yards, Yarrow at Scotstoun and Fairfield's at Govan.
Fairfield's was formed into Govan Shipbuilders in 1972, which was itself later nationalised and subsumed into British Shipbuilders in 1977.
The government of Margaret Thatcher broke up British Shipbuilders and denationalised it in 1988, when the former Fairfield yard was sold to the Norwegian Kvaerner group.
Kvaerner took the yard through another modernisation programme to enable it to specialise in the construction of liquefied natural gas and chemical tankers.
But in the late 1990s, the market became depressed and the yard had to find alternative contracts.
The yard passed to BAE Systems in 1999 and has found work over the past decade making destroyers and aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy.
BAE is a key partner in the construction of the two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers being built at the Portsmouth yard and in Scotland.
However, after their construction is complete, there is only expected to be the need for one centre for naval shipbuilding in the UK to build the next generation of Type 26 frigates.
The Clyde aircraft carrier work is due to finish in 2015. It is still not clear where Type 26 frigates will be built. There are no other orders on books.

"In one test, nearly half the subjects gave themselves mild electric shocks during 15 minutes of quiet time.
The findings, which came from shutting people away with no distractions and then quizzing them, have attracted criticism from some other researchers.
The contentious paper, in the journal Science, argues we are not very good at enjoyable, recreational thought.
Prof Timothy Wilson, who led the research at the University of Virginia, US, said: ""Our study participants consistently demonstrated that they would rather have something to do than to have nothing other than their thoughts for even a fairly brief period of time.""
This might not be a surprise if you are easily bored, or have ever picked at a painful scab in a quiet moment.
In fact, other researchers in the field have said the findings are overstated.
But the authors write that the question of whether people enjoy ""just thinking"" has been overlooked in psychological research.
Their work began with several trials involving university students, who were shut in a small room with blank walls and asked to sit at a table ""entertaining themselves with their own thoughts"".
After six, 12 or 15 minutes, they were asked whether the time was enjoyable and whether it was difficult to concentrate. On average, their answers were near the middle of a nine-point scale or worse.
To show that this was not a problem arising from the poky laboratory room, or a character flaw unique to flighty students, other experiments required a wider pool of volunteers, aged up to 77, to complete a similar test at home, sitting at a computer. Unpoliced in their own homes, many of them ""cheated"" by checking their phones or listening to music.
A control group was asked to find an external distraction, alone, like watching TV or browsing the internet, and they had a much better time than those left to try to daydream.
Finally, Prof Wilson's team did the electric shock experiment to try to find out if quiet, solo thinking was unpleasant enough that people would actually prefer something nasty to happen. Sure enough, 18 of 42 people, more of them men than women, chose to give themselves at least one mild shock on the ankle when left alone for 15 minutes.
""It was kind of like a severe static shock, it was not a huge jolt, but it was a little painful,"" Prof Wilson told the BBC's Naked Scientists programme. ""They seem to want to shock themselves out of boredom, so to speak.""
These were all people who had experienced the same shock already and declared that, if given $5, they would part with some of it in order not to be zapped again. People who didn't think they'd pay to avoid the shock were excluded - as was one man who pushed the button 190 times.
""I'm not sure what was up with him,"" Prof Wilson said.
Some UK researchers have questioned aspects of the study, including the level of shock delivered, which was higher for men than women (based on early results in which women rated shocks as more painful) but was not varied between individuals. They point to the fact that individual pain thresholds vary widely, and that hypothetical payments can exaggerate people's answers.
Prof Wilson says he isn't declaring humans incapable of contemplation. ""I don't want to exaggerate this. I do think that all of us, in our daily lives, do find our minds wandering to pleasant topics or thinking about something we're looking forward to. I think what's hard... is doing this on the spot.""
Prof Ivo Vlaev, a behavioural psychologist at Warwick University and Imperial College, London, thinks the findings are ""very interesting"" but the electric shocks could be over-emphasised.
""The bottom line is that they felt miserable,"" he told BBC News. ""Research has shown that happiness is not only about experiencing pleasure. You need a sense of meaning and purpose - which you lack in these conditions. And when you have a task to do, you do have that sense - even if it's a simple task.""
Dr Chris Chambers, a senior research fellow at Cardiff University's School of Psychology, was less impressed with the results.
""This is essentially a study showing that people don't like to be bored,"" he told BBC News. ""How this could take up 11 experiments in a major scientific journal is a little mystifying.
""The most interesting aspect to the study is that their research subjects preferred to give themselves electric shocks rather than experience boredom. Perhaps the subjects simply did it to stay awake, and having now read the author's paper from beginning to end I can understand their plight.""","People are unhappy in their own company and some prefer painful experiences to their own thoughts, a new study claims.",28130690

"The 19-year-old produced a spell of 5-3 in 19 balls as six Glamorgan wickets fell in the last 13 overs of day one.
Ben Cox's aggressive 93 off 99 balls was the mainstay of the home innings, while Ed Barnard (60) and Tongue (41) led the lower-order resistance.
Timm van der Gugten, with 4-66, was the pick of the Glamorgan attack.
Worcestershire counter-attacked hard from their poor start as Cox, having come in on a hat-trick on 14-3, hit 15 fours before being brilliantly caught by Andrew Salter within sight of his century.
After two double century opening stands in three matches, this time both Worcestershire openers were back in the pavilion inside eight overs, Daryl Mitchell, who had scored 534 runs in his previous five innings, going for a third-ball duck.
Netherlands seamer van der Gugten claimed four of the first six wickets to fall in an accurate display, including Tom Fell and Brett D'Oliveira in successive balls.
But, in only his sixth Championship game, Tongue outshone everyone. He improved his best with both bat and ball, aided by some superb slip catching in the dramatic closing overs as only Jacques Rudolph (49 not out) reached double figures.
Worcestershire's Ben Cox told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
""It was an edgy start, going in at 14-3, and I wasn't backing myself. But, on a wicket like that, it sometimes suits my game to go out and try and put the pressure back on them.
""Fortunately my edges didn't go to hand. And iIt was a good catch (to get me out), but it's 93 from a position where we were really struggling and we're in a good position now.
""We couldn't be happier after that spell from Tonguey. That's one of the best spells I've kept to. We said it down at Glamorgan that there's going to be times that he has those spells, he clicks and hits the zone.""
Glamorgan's Jacques Rudolph told BBC Wales Sport:

"Around 150 countries are meeting in Kigali to try and agree a speedy ban on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases.
HFCs were introduced to limit damage to the ozone layer, but cause much greater levels of global warming than CO2.
However nations are divided over the speed and timing of any phase-out.
Concern over a growing hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica saw the Montreal Protocol agreed back in 1987.
The key aim was the removal of gases called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which scientists had determined were causing the destruction of ozone, which protects people and animals from the dangerous impacts of ultraviolet radiation.
Found in hairsprays, refrigeration and air conditioning, CFCs were ultimately replaced by factory-made hydrofluorocarbons, which essentially do the same job but without the damage to the Earth's protective layer.
The substitution worked. Earlier this year, scientists said that the ozone hole is showing ""the first fingerprints of healing.""
There has been just one unfortunate side effect caused by the solution.
HFCs are several thousand times better at retaining heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. HFCs have helped the ozone layer, but exacerbated global warming.
As well as being destructive, they are also the fastest growing greenhouse gases - increasing demand for air conditioning in emerging economies has seen the use of HFCs up by 10-15% per year.
Scientists, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), have warned about the warming dangers of HFCs.
Unusually, governments took heed and have sought an international approach to phase out all these chemicals.
This move has been given added urgency in the wake of the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep temperature rises this century well below 2C and as close as possible to 1.5C.
The scale of HFC growth is adding greater urgency say experts. After a year of negotiations, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase out these chemicals is expected to be agreed at this meeting in Kigali.
""It's a big piece, these are the fastest growing greenhouse gases right now, although they are still a small percentage,"" said Durwood Zaelke, from the Institute for Government and Sustainable Development (IGSD).
""But an amendment could bend the curve down quickly and take out 100 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent by mid century, and by the end of the century you'll avoid up to half a degree of warming.""
There are dozens of replacement gases emerging including natural alternatives like ammonia, hydrocarbons and ironically, CO2. Refrigerators based on these coolants are already available in some developed countries.
A new generation of short-lived refrigerant chemicals called Hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) are also coming on stream.
However countries meeting here in Kigali are divided over the speed at which existing HFCs should be phased out.
Around 100 nations including the US, EU, African and island states are pushing for a peak in their use by 2021. India, a large manufacturer of the gases, favours a much later date of 2031.
""The Montreal Protocol has a good track record of getting things done quickly and efficiently,"" said Gaby Drinkwater from Christian Aid.
""We would hope that there would be an ambitious baseline and an early freeze date for all parties concerned. The earlier the freeze date the better for the planet.""
There is a lot to play for. An early peak means a far greater impact on temperatures  - but it will cost a lot more in funding to help poorer nations adapt. The hope is that by having an early phase down, emerging economies will not take intermediate steps but go for the most advanced and sustainable options.
Unusually, industry and environmental campaigners are fairly well aligned on the need for an early phase out. Governments and private donors are willing to step into the breach and last month offered $80m to speed the transition.
There is also a hope that newer coolants will also spark more efficient cooling devices.
""If you increase the efficiency of your room air conditioner, you can double the climate benefits of HFC phase down,"" said Durwood Zaelke.
""So private funders have said this is a very good opportunity, and they have put together a fund that is designed to be a bridge to greater sources of funding.""
Ministers arrive in Rwanda on Thursday to lead the negotiations to a conclusion. There is still much detail to be agreed. However, in the light of the imminent ratification of the Paris agreement, and a new deal on aviation emissions, there is added pressure for the Kigali talks to succeed.
""A meeting like this has its ups and downs, we will go through that cycle,"" said Durwood Zaelke.
""We just want to land on the up, that's the key.""

"Accies travel to Ibrox for what will be Caixinha's first game in charge.
""It changes slightly because it is a little bit unknown how he best thinks to set up the players he's got,"" said player-manager Canning.
""If he comes in and does a good job and it is something you can learn from as a young manager then great.""
Caixinha took over on Monday, the day after Rangers recorded a creditable 1-1 draw away to city rivals and Premiership leaders Celtic in Graeme Murty's last game as caretaker manager.
Canning thought it would be ""good for the game"" in Scotland if the 46-year-old Portuguese proved to be the standard of coach that could improve Rangers.
But he is hoping he can outfox the former Santos Laguna and Al-Gharafa boss when his side visit Ibrox.
""I don't know much about him, but I've checked back at his previous clubs to see how he's played, but that is dependent on the players he's got,"" said Canning.
""I think he will come in and want to put his own stamp on it straight away.
""I don't think he'll feel the need to stick with what they've been doing.
""He might if he thinks that's the best way to go about it and it mirrors his philosophy and how he wants to play.""
Accies held Rangers to a 1-1 draw in the opening Scottish Premiership game of the season at Ibrox and then suffering a 6-0 beating there in this month's Scottish Cup quarter-final.
""The atmosphere in the stadium will be a little more intense than it would normally be,"" Canning predicted.

"Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of $300 (Â£230).
That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies.
The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade.
Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses.
Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months.
Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007.
""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""
The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan.
Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.""
Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest.
How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage.
Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified.
The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York.
Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy.

"Andrew Barnes, 61, hit Luke Down with four heavy axe blows to his head, leaving him with brain injuries and close to death.
Barnes, from Topsham, Devon, admitted attempted murder and was jailed for 15 and a half years at Exeter Crown Court.
The judge described the axe attack as an ""impetuous moment of madness"".
More on Andrew Barnes, and other Devon news
Mr Down, 29, had been staying at Barnes's flat for free when he was attacked with the long-handled axe as he slept in the lounge.
He had been paying his way by bringing round alcohol and food, but Barnes claimed he had become violent and abusive towards him, the court heard.
The trigger for the attack was Mr Down's threat to claim squatter's rights and barricade himself in the flat.
The court heard how the injuries would have been fatal if Barnes had removed the protective cover over the blade.
Jailed Andrew Barnes was once a drug cartel pilot, flying cocaine from Colombia to the United States.
Public school educated at Blundells in Tiverton, Barnes moved to America where he ran his own freight airline in the late 1970s.
But his business ran into financial trouble and in the early 1980s Barnes was employed by the Medellin cartel, flying their cocaine to remote US airstrips and Caribbean islands.
The planes left Colombia loaded with cocaine and returned crammed with so many dollar bills that drug lords such as Pablo Escobar built apartments with millions hidden in the cavity walls.
Barnes worked mainly for Carlos Lehder, who he testified against at his trial in Jacksonville in 1988.
He was jailed for eight years in the US after admitting drug smuggling, before being moved to a witness protection scheme.
He returned to Britain in the late 1990s and descended into a spiral of alcohol abuse.
He moved into a flat owned by his family in Topsham and worked for 18 months at the SPCK religious bookshop on Cathedral Green.
In July 2001 he set light to the 15th century building housing the bookshop, causing Â£200,000 damage and forcing the evacuation of the neighbouring Ship Inn.
He also set light to a boat on the banks of the River Exe after the owner refused to sell it to him, and was jailed for four years.
He was a well-known figure in Exeter, Exmouth and Topsham, regaling people with tall stories of his exploits as a drug-smuggling pilot.

"Dassey and his uncle Steven Avery were convicted of murdering a young woman, Teresa Halbach, in 2005.
His conviction was overturned in 2016 on the basis his confession, made as a 16-year-old, was coerced.
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Chicago, backed the ruling on Thursday.
But the 27-year-old remains in jail, facing the possibility of a retrial.
Lawyers have vowed to fight to free Dassey, whose case garnered international attention after featuring in the popular Netflix series.
In a joint statement, lawyers said they were ""overjoyed"", adding: ""We look forward to working to secure his release from prison as soon as possible. As of today's date, Brendan Dassey has lost 4,132 days of his life to prison.""
Making a Murderer investigated the killing of Ms Halbach, whose charred remains were found at Avery's car salvage yard a week after she went there to photograph a minivan for sale, and the subsequent court cases.
Dassey, then just 16 years old, confessed to helping his uncle Avery - who had already served 18 years for a crime he did not commit - rape, kill and mutilate Ms Halbach.
He was sentenced to life in prison.
But the documentary filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Dassey and Avery.
In 2016, Judge William Duffin ordered he be free immediately after finding investigators in the 2007 trial made ""repeated false promises"" false promises to Dassey by assuring him ""he had nothing to worry about"".
When considered with ""Dassey's age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult"", he considered the confession coerced.
But Dassey remained in jail while prosecutors appealed the decision.
In Chicago on Thursday, they lost that appeal.
The court described the method used to get Dassey to confess as ""death by a thousand cuts"", with judge David Hamilton saying the decision ""breaks new ground and poses troubling questions for police and prosecutors"".
The ruling means Dassey could be released in the next 90 days.
However, Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, said it seemed likely they would appeal it once more.
""We anticipate seeking review by the entire Seventh Circuit or the United States Supreme Court and hope that today's erroneous decision will be reversed,"" he told new agency Reuters in an email.","An US appeals court has upheld a decision to overturn the conviction of Brendan Dassey, whose case was the focus of documentary Making a Murderer.",40381402

"He was also dealing them, and at one point faced a possible jail sentence.
Born in the Scottish new town of Cumbernauld, Ryan began experimenting with drugs when he was 12, initially because he was curious and had fallen in with likeminded friends.
""I tried everything - cocaine, Valium, ecstasy, speed, heroin... I'd go on benders for two or three days at a time, and I'd take five or 10 ecstasy tablets in one night,"" he says.
""From the age of 15 to 20 I took drugs every single day.""
Thankfully for Ryan, everything changed when he was 20, and he has not touched drugs ever since. While the cynical may raise their eyebrows, Ryan, now 37, says he discovered God and quit overnight.
Without the drugs, he was able to get his life back, and aged 24 he launched a catering company called Regis Banqueting.
Today the 13-year-old business has blue-chip clients including mobile phone network O2, luxury carmaker Bentley, and investment bank JP Morgan.
With drugs his main interest and income at the time, Ryan left school in Cumbernauld, 13 miles north-east of Glasgow, aged 16.
Four years later he was dealing thousands of pounds worth of drugs a week, and if he continued he says it was clear that he would become a ""big time gangster drug dealer"".
Trying to run away from his lifestyle, Ryan decided in 2000 to go to New Zealand for a year in search of a fresh start.
But it fell apart just two weeks after he arrived, when New Zealand customs intercepted a package of 100 ecstasy pills that Ryan had posted to himself from Scotland.
Facing a jail term, he phoned a friend back in Scotland. She said that she would pray for him and suggested he do the same.
Ryan says: ""I thought 'you're off your head' but I decided to try it, and I got down beside my bed and I said, 'I don't believe that there is a God, but if you're real then show me that you're real and I'll believe in you.'""
Out on bail, Ryan had to go to the police station every two days, but his appetite for drugs was undiminished.
It was only when he met two female hitchhikers that things changed. The women took him out for lunch, then to church, and allowed him to move in to their home.
""That was when I thought there was maybe something to this because why would two complete strangers do that? That was the catalyst for change.""
Ryan says that discovering his faith was fast, and the change immediate. Drugs suddenly lost all appeal, and he threw all the substances that he had into the sea, and has been clean ever since.
""I know most people who have been taking drugs don't have that experience. Most people do ok for a bit then they relapse. Everyone's journey is different but that was mine.""
While Ryan escaped jail time in New Zealand, his visa was revoked, and he returned to Scotland in May 2000.
He joined a church, the evangelical Freedom City Church in Cumbernauld, met his wife and got married.
To earn money he got a job working with drug and alcohol addicts, where he was able to draw on his own experience to try to help others to quit.
However, when the funding for his role ran out a few years later he found himself without work. It was then that the opportunity to start his own business came about.
His church wanted a catering company to run the cafe attached to their conference centre on an ad hoc basis, and the then-pastor suggested Ryan might fit the bill.
Despite having little to no catering experience he jumped at the chance and Regis Banqueting was formed. Ryan attended catering college alongside running the cafe and learned as he went along.
""I had to phone my mother-in-law to ask how you make steak pie,"" he says.
""I was young and naive.  If I knew what I know now, I probably wouldn't have started it.""
To help Ryan expand the business into contract catering, the Princes Trust, the UK start-up support charity led by the Prince of Wales, gave him a £5,000 loan.
While Ryan says the first three years were tough, with him taking a salary of just £6,000 in year one, over time the clients and contracts got bigger.
Cumbernauld-based Regis Banqueting now has 65 staff - 20 full-time and 40 part-time, many of whom are seasonal - and annual turnover is £1.3m.
Meanwhile, Ryan and the company have won a number of awards including the Royal Bank of Scotland's young business of the year crown, and director of the year from the Institute of Directors organisation.
Prof Eleanor Shaw, head of the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Strathclyde, says it is Ryan's motivation and enthusiasm that helps make him such a success.
""Catering is a really difficult market to be competitive in, but he has such energy,"" she says. ""He's very hardworking and is so motivated that it brushes off on everyone around him.""
Looking back on his troubled youth, Ryan says he knows that his life might have turned out very differently.
As a result he tries to help others who face addiction and poverty, for instance by employing former addicts and ex-offenders among his staff.
He is also in the process of starting another company, alongside Regis, that will focus on creating a brand of casual dining restaurants, the first to be launched in Glasgow next year. The plan is to expand across Scotland and the UK before going international.
""I say to my wife sometimes that it's amazing how we're making more money than a doctor or lawyer - and we're making sandwiches,"" says Ryan.

"Lieutenant Colonel Benedict Tomkins, 49, of Defence, Equipment and Support, based at Abbey Wood, near Bristol, is facing trial in the US.
He allegedly attacked the woman in her hotel room where he went under false pretences after a drinks reception.
The woman told the court Mr Tomkins was ""very aggressive"" and ""took control"".
The trial is being heard at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. It is the first-ever court martial which will be held in the US and UK to allow more witnesses to testify.
The court heard that Mr Tomkins said he had had sexual activity with the woman, which ""wasn't rose petals or cupid's arrows, it was fairly animal"".
The incident is alleged to have happened after a dinner and a drinks reception at the Sheraton Hotel, Kampala, on 7 January 2015.
By the end of the evening, the young woman said she was ""very drunk"" when Mr Tomkins went to her hotel room.
""There was no talking, no romantic lead up to something that I recall. He did get much more aggressive and used some level of force to take things further,"" she said.
""The room was spinning, it was a very brief memory.""
They later exchanged messages and he thanked her for a ""wonderful evening"" to which she agreed. She told investigators she initially feared reporting the incident in case it would harm her career.

"Campaigners have asked the university to reconsider the move, highlighting its ""strong record"" in educating people from disadvantaged groups.
But the university says it needs to reduce costs in line with its student numbers.
University and College Union (UCU) members will meet later to discuss what form the action should take.
Two-thirds (67%) of UCU members voted for strike action.
Members of its sister union UNISON are voting in a separate ballot, closing on 22 May.
Both academic and professional support workers' posts will be closed under the university's proposals.
Staff and students will also lobby the university's board of governors at their general meeting on Tuesday.
Campaigners argue that the university has a track record in ""providing educational opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged groups in society"".
They say in the academic year starting September 2012, nearly half the students at London Met were from minority ethnic groups, compared with 16% of university students nationally.
In addition, about half were from the poorest groups in society.

""Far from further cutbacks, this university is in desperate need of investment to expand access to education.""

"Mr Kaczynski's Law and Justice party never accepted an inquiry that found the Smolensk crash was an accident.
The party, which was returned to power in elections last month, accuses Mr Tusk of negligence.
He resigned as prime minister last year to become European Council president.
Government spokesman Elzbieta Witek said Poland's State Tribunal would be ""a good thing"" for Mr Tusk, referring to a court that handles cases against elected and other senior officials.
She was echoing a call from a government minister, Adam Lipinski, who said the former prime minister had ""a lot to answer for"" and should be prosecuted after his initial term of office came to an end in Brussels in 2017.
On 10 April 2010, 96 Poles were killed when the Tupolev plane they were travelling in went down in thick fog, short of the runway near Smolensk in western Russia.
The president, his wife and senior government officials were on their way to Katyn to mark the 70th anniversary of the murder of thousands of Polish officers by Soviet secret police.
Separate investigations ruled out any kind of plot, blaming the conditions and poorly trained pilots. Leaked transcripts also indicated the pilots had come under pressure from people on board.
Mr Lipinski, a minister in the prime minister's office, told Polish newspaper Super Express that Mr Tusk had ""given away"" the Smolensk investigation to the Russians, had been negligent in explaining the disaster and had failed to bring back the wreckage to Poland.
The Law and Justice party is still run by the late president's brother and identical twin, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, although the prime minister is Beata Szydlo.

The Hovefield site - which is subject to a High Court injunction preventing further development - is less than three miles (5km) by road - from the Dale Farm traveller site in Wickford.
Dale Farm was Europe's largest traveller site before about 80 families were evicted from unlawful plots in 2011.
Jill Walsh, of the Hovefields Residents Association, said an English Traveller family in five caravans left the site on Friday.
After they departed, she said, a number of large lorries carrying concrete, hardcore and three mobile homes drove down Hovefields Avenue and onto the five acre field at the end of the road.
Mrs Walsh said because of the narrowness of the road one of their neighbours - an elderly couple - had their fence ripped out and shrubbery damaged so that the lorries could get through.

Police say the suspects are due to appear in court on Wednesday in Lahore. The victims have been identified as Shehzad Masih and his wife Shama.
About 200 people in Lahore, mainly from the Christian community and human rights organisations, protested against the killings, which took place in the town of Kot Radha Kishan about 60km (40 miles) to the south-west.

Pakistan's blasphemy laws carry a potential death sentence for anyone who insults Islam.
Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have been found guilty of desecrating the Koran or of blasphemy.
While most of them have been sentenced to death by the lower courts, many sentences have been overturned due to lack of evidence.
However, correspondents say even the mere accusation of blasphemy, or defending someone accused of blasphemy, is enough to make someone a target for hardliners.

Wigan rugby general manager Kris Radlinski, who accompanied Flower to the hearing at the Rugby Football League in Leeds, said in a statement: ""Wigan Warriors would like to go on record in saying that the RFL disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity.
""We fully support their assessment of Saturday night's incident involving our player, Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal.
""We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and his family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens' win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.""
In becoming the first man to be sent off in a Grand Final, Flower left his side down to 12 men for the vast majority of the match at Old Trafford, which St Helens won to end an eight-year wait for the Super League title.
Saints chairman Eamonn McManus said: ""The sport of rugby league should not be judged by this event, but by how it deals with it.
""We must assist [Flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.""
For Wigan, the defeat ended their defence of the Super League crown and the pursuit of a fourth title.
Former Wigan and Great Britain player Martin Offiah told BBC Radio 5 live: ""There is a lot of emotion around what was a big occasion but sadly it was in effect ruined by this incident in which I believe both players played their part. It was a sad day for rugby league.
""The sport was on show, it's a big event and the pictures are very graphic and all the apologies in the world won't wipe these away.
""No one can condone that second punch to the head and he's apologised for that but Lance Hohaia must take some consideration for his actions.""
Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police said in a tweet they are investigating ""abusive social media activity"" surrounding the Grand Final.",Wigan prop Ben Flower has been given a six-month ban - the longest in Super League history - for punching St Helens' Lance Hohaia.,29612687
"A JCB spokesperson confirmed that the company had ended its membership of the CBI, but did not give reasons why.
Sky news had earlier reported that it was due to the group's response to the referendum outcome
JCB's chairman, Lord Bamford, was a prominent supporter of the Brexit campaign.
During the campaign he said: ""The UK is the world's fifth largest trading nation. We therefore have little to fear from leaving the EU.""
He also wrote to his 6,500 UK employees to explain why he favoured a vote to leave the European Union, saying he was ""very confident that we can stand on our own two feet"".
The CBI, on the other hand, warned that a UK exit from the EU would cause a ""serious economic shock"", potentially costing the country Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs.
A CBI spokesman said: ""It's always a shame to see any member leave the CBI, but we recognise that businesses have competing priorities and we respect that.""

"Poole Borough Council plans to put charges up by 10% in 2017 and by 5% every year until 2020.
Poole Beach Hut Association said beach huts were being treated as ""cash cows"".
The authority said the rent rise ""reflected high demand"". Almost 1,400 names are on the waiting list for hiring its 1,100 seaside huts annually.
Council figures show prospective beach hut tenants could face a minimum wait of up to 18 years at some of its seven locations.
Bob Lister, from the association, said demand was lower due to the fact applicants could pay to apply for huts in more than one site.
""We know that most of those members who got huts last year had waited less than two years,"" he said.
""We've found there are people waiting for a specific hut and that is distorting the figures.""
Mr Lister said rent on his own hut would be more than Â£2,500 by 2020- an increase of Â£1,100.
""For a lot of beach hut owners who live in flats, the hut is their life, their garden, their community - at these prices they'll be for the holiday home people and the 'Sandbanks set' who can afford them, rather than the people who actually need it,"" he added.
Kevin McErlane, from the council, said: ""Demand for our beach huts continues to rise and for those people who do not wish to hire a hut on an annual basis there are a number of alternative options available.""","Beach huts at a Dorset resort could become unaffordable following rent hikes, tenants have claimed.",35820483
"The report, carried out by charity Relate and based on a survey of 20,980 people in relationships from 2013-15, suggested 2.87 million people were in ""distressed"" relationships.
Dr David Marjoribanks, from Relate, said constant bickering could have a ""far-reaching"" impact on children.
On average they did worse in school and could even fall into crime, he said.
""It is not just the actual breakdown of the relationship itself, it's specifically the conflict that surrounds that,"" Dr Marjoribanks said.
""It means that when relationships end, it is not deemed to inevitably harm children, far from it.
""It is the conflict in intact relationships that can be just as damaging, as when relationships end,"" he added.
""Children who grow up with parents who have highly-conflicted relationships are much more likely to have mental and physical health problems, to not do as well at school and end up in antisocial behaviour and criminality even.""
It may have seemed a small thing but Sophie*, 28, knew her marriage was over when she came home from work to have lunch with her out-of-work husband and he expected her to make it.
Things had not been right for some time. There had been arguments about money, jobs and housework shortly after the wedding, often in front of their young son. But soon communication shut down almost entirely as both felt the arguments were always the same and nothing would ever change.
Days would go by with neither of them talking to each other.
They tried counselling but it came at a cost and they found themselves forced to choose between a counselling session or buying food for the week.
In January last year, after three years of marriage, Sophie told her husband, 41, it was over.
""As soon as we separated I immediately felt lighter. I did not have to do all this stuff for someone who did not do anything,"" she said.
Both are now in new relationships, and Sophie, who lives in West Yorkshire, says she now tries to make time to talk about things as soon as they come up and to be more open about money.

Researchers looked at data from the Understanding Society survey of 20,980 people which asked people how often they argued, how frequently they considered divorce and regretted the relationship, and the extent of their unhappiness.
They said their findings suggested 2.87 million people, which equates to 18% of married or cohabiting couples, were living in ""distressed"" relationships, where the strains were deemed to be ""clinically significant"" by counsellors.
The number of ""distressed"" relationships reached a high in 2011 and 2012 but have not yet returned to pre-recession levels, the data showed.
""There is a pattern of relationship strain increasing during recession years - where economic strain increases, for example low income, unemployment, a build-up of debt, the strain on the relationship increases,"" Dr Marjoribanks said.
The research also found:
Dr Marjoribanks said many couples suffered in silence for years and only sought help when it was too late to salvage their relationship.
Jan Artingstall from Therapy Cheshire, who is listed in the Counselling Directory, believes people today spend so much time communicating via text and social media that they have forgotten how to talk.
""People have lost the art of talking about how they feel. It's like we have gone back to being children who don't have the language to communicate feelings,"" she said.
A common problem among couples was mistrust built around text messages sent between work colleagues and partners spying on each other's online communications, she added.
Her advice is for couples to sit down for 10 minutes to talk about their day and take joint responsibility for the state of the relationship, rather than pointing fingers.
She also said children who saw their parents fall out and make up were learning a useful lesson but daily and embedded conflict was damaging.
""Children are very perceptive to atmosphere. It doesn't have to be a shouting match - they can pick up on stonewalling and tense body language.
""Children won't say 'Are you unhappy Mummy or Daddy?' They just accept and absorb the atmosphere and feel unhappy inside.""
There were 114,720 divorces in England and Wales in 2013, down 3% on 2012, the most recent figures available from the Office of National Statistics show. The number of divorces was highest among men and women aged between 40 and 44.
In Scotland, 9,030 divorces were granted in 2014-15, 6% fewer than in the previous 12 months, Scottish government figures show. Northern Ireland saw a slight rise in divorce rates from 2,403 in 2013 to 2,455 in 2014, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.

"The 80 signatories include leading figures in the Asian hospitality industry and award-winning gospel singer Rachel Kerr.
The PM is expected to recommend Britain remains in a reformed EU.
Remain campaigners said several Commonwealth leaders, including India's PM, had urged Britain to stay in.
The 80 figures from Britain's Commonwealth community criticised Mr Cameron for a lack of ambition in his EU reform demands, which he hopes to put to the public in a referendum in June.
They claimed the UK government's immigration policy discriminates against non-EU citizens.
In their letter to Mr Cameron, published by the Vote Leave campaign, they say: ""As patriotic Britons of Commonwealth backgrounds, we saw the EU renegotiation as an opportunity to rediscover Britain's global vocation.
""As long as Britain's trade policy is controlled by the EU, we cannot sign bilateral free trade agreements with Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Australia, New Zealand or for that matter any other non-EU state.
""Vested interests on the Continent sustain a relatively protectionist policy. We have to apply the EU's common external tariff to exports from Commonwealth countries - hurting consumers here as well as producers there.
""At the same time, our immigration policy forces us, in effect, to turn away qualified workers from the Commonwealth so as to free up unlimited space for migrants from the EU.
""The descendants of the men who volunteered to fight for Britain in two world wars must stand aside in favour of people with no connection to the United Kingdom.""
One of the signatories, Pasha Khandaker, president of the UK Bangladesh Caterers Association UK, said the 12,000 curry houses his organisation represents ""have been struggling to recruit the talent that they need because of the difficulties associated with employing people from outside of the EU"".
""If the UK had a fairer immigration system it would be easier for businesses to recruit skilled workers regardless of their nationality,"" he added.
Other signatories include Rachel Kerr, who won a Mobo award in 2012, in the gospel music category, and Moni Verma, founder of Veetee Rice, a UK-based food business with a turnover of Â£80m a year.
A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: ""Several Commonwealth leaders have been very clear that Britain is stronger, safer and better off in Europe.
""Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Britain is the entry point for trade right across Europe; while Australia's former deputy prime minister said the Commonwealth could never replace the trade Britain does with the EU.
""We get the best of both worlds in Europe, trading freely with the world's largest market, as well as accessing free trade deals with over 50 countries around the globe.
""While Leave campaigners may look back with rose-tinted spectacles, they have no plan for what Britain outside the EU would look like, and no guarantee that trade, jobs and prices wouldn't be hit.""

"The Cambridge history student knew the ""significance"" of the monument but did not realise he was dangling from a war memorial, the Court of Appeal was told.
Gilmour, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, was jailed for 16 months for violent disorder in July.
The 21-year-old is appealing against his sentence.
Judges heard Gilmour had taken LSD and valium before joining the central London protests against increased tuition fees last December.
He was seen hanging from a Union flag on the Cenotaph and leaping on to the bonnet of a Jaguar - part of a royal convoy.
Gilmour was previously found by a judge at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court to have thrown a rubbish bin at the vehicle.
His lawyers are also challenging this ruling as part of the appeal.
The crown court judge had accepted that the incident at the Cenotaph did not form part of the violent disorder, but described it as ""outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour"".
During his several-hour-long rampage, Gilmour was also found to have kicked the window of Topshop's flagship store on Oxford Street.
He ended the day in possession of the leg of a mannequin.
Gilmour's defence QC, David Spens, said his client did not know what the Cenotaph looked like and, as he had lived ""without a television for 10 years"", this was ""not actually as surprising as might have been thought"".
The court heard he had turned to drink and drugs after being rejected by his biological father, the writer Heathcote Williams.
Mr Spens said he had ""successfully reformed and rehabilitated himself"" and addressed the ""underlying drug and alcohol problems"".

"The Swiss eighth seed played magnificently in a 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-4 victory at Roland Garros.
Wawrinka, 30, brought an end to Djokovic's 28-match winning streak as he claimed his second Grand Slam title.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Djokovic had been hoping to become the eighth man to complete the set of all four major titles.
But the Serb will have to wait at least another 12 months before attempting to match the full set of major titles collected by Andre Agassi, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Roger Federer, Rod Laver, Rafael Nadal and Fred Perry.
The 28-year-old had been a strong favourite to finally get his hands on the Coupe des Mousquetaires after beating nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and third seed Andy Murray, but he was outplayed by Wawrinka.
""It was an incredible atmosphere on court and I felt emotion like I never have before,"" said Wawrinka.
""I would like to thank my coach Magnus Norman. You played in the final without winning but this victory is yours as well as mine.""
Djokovic was effusive in his praise for the new champion: ""There are things that are more important in life than victories and that is character and respect - Stan you are a great champion with big heart.""
Their last four matches in Grand Slams had gone to five sets and this was every bit as good in terms of quality, with Wawrinka hitting 60 winners as his aggression broke down the seemingly invincible Djokovic defence.
The victory makes him only the second Swiss to win at Roland Garros after Roger Federer, the man he beat in the quarter-finals.
Having lost the first set of the final following a poor service game at 3-3, Wawrinka came storming back with a barrage of winners that left Djokovic looking lost for a response.
Four break points came and went in the second set before the fifth arrived in the shape of a set point, and Wawrinka finally converted to level the match.
It was merely a sign of things to come as the eighth seed tore into the Djokovic serve in the third, and despite seeing off three break points for 1-1, there was little the top seed could do four games later.
A brilliant forehand winner was followed by an equally breathtaking backhand to earn three break points, and the first was converted as Wawrinka moved forward and hammered a short ball.
The crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier roared as the Swiss hit an outrageous winner around the net post on his way to securing the set.
Djokovic was now facing a third French Open final defeat and he dug in, taking advantage of a lull at the opposite end of the court to fashion a 3-0 lead in the fourth.
The match was now on Wawrinka's racquet, however, and he came storming back to level at 3-3 after some brilliant defence earned him the break.
Djokovic called on everything he had to stay in touch, finding two volleys - the second a lunging effort reminiscent of his coach Boris Becker - to save break points with the score level in the set.
Moments later it looked as though Djokovic would force the fifth set that had seemed inevitable as he moved 0-40 up, but there was another burst of brilliance to come from Wawrinka.
A volley, a backhand and a serve got him out of trouble, and he rode the wave of five successive points into the next game as two screaming backhand passes at 4-4 gave him the chance to serve out for the title.
It was never likely to be easy and, after a possible ace was overruled by the umpire on his first match point, the Swiss had to face a break point as Djokovic clung on to his career Slam hopes.
The Serb could only send a forehand wide under pressure, and given a second opportunity to take the championship, Wawrinka steered another of those trademark backhands down the line and raised his arms in triumph.",Stan Wawrinka stunned Novak Djokovic to win his first French Open title and thwart the world number one's career Grand Slam hopes.,33042056
"Since the initial fall-out there has been a legal challenge and a general election.
While everyone waits to see exactly what will happen, Leave voter Paul Austin has told the BBC  why he made his choice and whether, a year on, he would vote the same way again.
Mr Austin lives in North Yorkshire and runs an interior fitting-out business. He has spent 36 years working in the construction industry around the world.
""I was quite an aggressive Brexiteer and my friends were probably sick to the stomach of me trying to persuade them all to vote Leave,"" he said.
""I wanted limited immigration, not a ban, because I feel that it's totally uncontrolled.
""I'm also still concerned about taxation and VAT. I think the payments we make are very high and that money is going to other countries when it could be used better here.""
However, Mr Austin says that on recent trips to the EU he has started to pay more attention to the immigration queue for non-EU passport holders - and is already starting to feel that he is becoming an outsider.
""I think other Europeans are starting to look at us as if we're a bit different and I've now started to back-pedal a bit on how I think about things,"" he explained.
""I have ended up with more questions than before the referendum.""
As well as the continuing political conversations around Brexit, Mr Austin said recent news events had played a significant role in him moving from a clear Leave stance to one where he was less certain.
The recent news story about about baby Charlie Gard and the decisions about his continuing treatment had a powerful impact on him.
""I was quite upset by it and I'm glad his parents were able to get access to the European Court of Human Rights so he can be kept on life support until another group of experts have had time to look at his case,"" he added.
""But I wonder now about what this means when we leave and if means that other real people won't be able to have one more throw of the dice to have their case heard.
""I'm not saying that had the court not been available judgements would have been unjust, but they would have been unfair because they lost that extra level of consideration.""
Another key factor behind Mr Austin's decision to vote Leave was his belief in the potential for the UK to expand its trading base around the world and access more competitive markets.
However, Mr Austin says that since the Grenfell Tower fire last week he now has concerns about how rigorous quality checks will be post-Brexit for imported goods.
""It's made me wonder about the sort of building materials that might be able to come into the country that might not have been tested properly or as well as things are now.
""At the moment we have the European kite mark which means the goods we buy are strongly and intensively vetted and tested.
""I still want more aggressive trading around the world but I'm also starting to think that maybe 40 years of working together to do all this in terms of quality control might be wasted.""

Leicester's Selby, who beat Ding Junhui in last year's final, looked on course for a whitewash by going 8-0 ahead.
Irishman O'Brien claimed the ninth and 11th to avoid becoming only the second player to exit without winning a frame, but Selby wrapped up the match.
He will face either Wales' Ryan Day or China's Xiao Guodong in the next round.
Selby has enjoyed a stellar season - claiming four ranking titles, including this month's China Open, though no player has followed that by winning the world title in the same season.
The world number one made top breaks of 92, 77 and 66 as he began his attempt to win his third title at the Sheffield venue, which is holding the event for a 40th year.
""I'm very happy to get through and happy with the scoreline but my performance could have been better,"" Selby said. ""I was not killing enough frames off in the first visit and would have liked to have capitalised on them.
""I would like to win every tournament I play in. I am confident and I am playing well enough.
""Even if I don't play well, I have a never-say-die attitude and you have to scrape me off the table.
""I was gutted not to go 9-0 because I know the history that there has only been one whitewash here. I was devastated to go in after the first session at 8-1.""
Having made light work of O'Brien, Selby has almost a week off, returning to action next Saturday.
Dubliner O'Brien came through qualifying by beating David Gilbert in a final-frame decider - the longest frame in snooker history, timed at two hours, three minutes and 41 seconds.
But he struggled badly in the first-round encounter, managing a high break of just 32, although he avoided the ignominy of joining Eddie Charlton - who lost 10-0 to John Parrott in 1992 - as the only players not to win a frame at the championship.
He has now lost six successive meetings against Selby, claiming just four frames in a run stretching back to 2006.
""When I won my first frame, it was good because the crowd were so supportive and willing me not to get the whitewash,"" said O'Brien.
In an all-Scottish tie, qualifier Stephen Maguire claimed eight frames in a row to trounce Anthony McGill 10-2.
Maguire, who has won five ranking titles, has fallen to 24th in the world but was in good scoring form, compiling breaks of 97, 66 and 60 to go through.
Meanwhile, five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was pegged back to a 5-4 lead over debutant Gary Wilson.
Former taxi driver Wilson fell 5-1 behind but took the last three frames of the session, including the ninth having needed snookers.
On the other table, Kyren Wilson leads 5-4 against Crucible first-timer David Grace.

"Scientists say the new species is a member of the group that gave rise to crocodiles and dinosaurs.
The reptile lived at a time when the Earth was recovering from a mass extinction that wiped out most animals.
The discovery may shed light on how the group of animals evolved and spread.
About 252 million years ago, a mass extinction devastated life on land and in the oceans. Some 90% of species disappeared.
At the time, the Earth was very different from today, with continents grouped into the supercontinent, Pangaea.
Researchers led by Eudald Mujal of Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain, examined fossilised footprints from about 247 to 248 million years ago found in the Pyrenees mountains in Catalonia.
They found most tracks were made by the ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs, a group known as archosauromorphs.
Most footprints were small, about half a metre in length, although a few were longer than three metres.
Among them was a new footprint that is thought to be a new species of reptile, Prorotodactylus mesaxonichnus.
The makers of the footprints could belong to the Euparkeria, a group of dinosaur relatives known from the same time period in Poland, Russia, China and South Africa.
Co-researcher Josep Fortuny of the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont said the footprints suggest the animals, measuring around half a metre, used all four limbs to walk and often also left marks with their tails.
""Some footprints point to the possibility of bipedal locomotion in specific moments with the aim of moving faster,"" he said.
The researchers think archosauromorphs dominated the river beds of the ancient Pyrenees.
The group may have been key to the recovery of ecosystems after the extinction, going on to spread across the supercontinent.
""These tracks represent the first evidence of the vertebrate recovery of the End-Permian extinction,"" Eudald Mujal told BBC News.
He said the search was underway for fossilised bones of the animals that made the tracks.
The research is published in the journal, PLOS ONE.

"The art of Kremlinology has moved on since then. And I'm proud to say I've come up with my own 21st Century method for keeping up to date with the current thinking in the corridors of Russian power: it involves walking to the train station opposite the BBC Moscow office, going up to the souvenir stand and looking at the fridge magnets on sale.
You can tell a lot from Russian fridge magnets. This week's selection includes several different ""Vladimir Putin in military camouflage"" magnets, complete with patriotic slogans, like: ""Together we are a force to be reckoned with!"" and ""We will always look out for our guys!""
Kremlin policy in a nutshell.
One fridge magnet in particular caught my eye. It looks just like a $100 bill but, in place of the American founding father Benjamin Franklin, there is a portrait of Vladimir Putin.
I know. It's only a fridge magnet. But it encapsulates the whole Putin-Trump/Russia-America saga. After six months of Donald Trump in the White House, Russians are beginning to feel that their country enjoys considerable influence over America.
And who could blame them for thinking that? Particularly in light of allegations of the Kremlin hacking a US election and putting a Russian puppet in the White House, and with all the rumours of Russian lawyers, Russian lobbyists and Russian oligarchs conspiring with the Trump team and the Trump family.
It will be up to official investigations to establish whether there was, indeed, collusion. But even the suggestion that there may have been has got the whole world talking about the power of Putin's Russia and the weakness of Trump's America.
There are times when Vladimir Putin seems to be basking in the infamy of running a cyber superpower.
There is just one problem for President Putin. It's the problem of all fridge magnets, really. They look so pretty when you buy them in the shop. But they don't stick to every fridge.
When it began, Donald Trump's presidency looked very pretty to Moscow. The Russians expected that America's new leader would herald a new era in US-Russian cooperation.
At the time, a news anchor on Russian State TV described Trump as ""an Alpha male... a real man."" The day after America's presidential election, one Russian state official told me that she had celebrated Trump's victory with a cigar and a bottle of champagne.
But, after six months of President Trump, US sanctions against Russia remain in place.
The two Russian diplomatic compounds, closed by President Obama last December, remain shut. And the idea of a ""Grand Deal"" with America, much hoped for here at the start of the Trump presidency, has disappeared from the pages of the Russian dailies.
Moscow is not blaming Donald Trump directly for this. One Russian newspaper, Nezavisimaya Gazeta, explained recently that, in the current atmosphere, ""Trump doesn't have the slightest possibility to improve Russian-US relations, since any step, any glance even in the direction of Russia is met with suspicion back home and even viewed as treason.""
A few days ago I was chatting to a Russian senator. He complained that the intense pressure President Trump was facing over the Russia question was complicating US-Russian diplomacy.
""Trump is like a prisoner,"" he told me, ""And how can you talk to a prisoner?""
But Russia and America are talking. Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump have now met, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. And, although progress is slower than Moscow would like, there is cautious talk of cooperation: in Syria, for example, and in the area of cyber security.
Mr Trump continues to argue there is nothing wrong in seeking a closer relationship with Russia. He insists it is in America's interest to do so.
And, while America's president and America's Western allies often appear poles apart on a variety of issues, Donald Trump seems drawn like a magnet to Vladimir Putin.
Indeed, he has openly praised the Kremlin leader. Yet Russia is casting a shadow over the US administration. For Donald Trump, could this prove to be a fatal attraction?","There was a time when to work out what was happening in Moscow you needed to read between the lines in Pravda, or look at the line-up of Soviet officials at a Red Square parade and study who was standing next to whom.",40683083

"The Electoral Commission said 38 MPs had highlighted people, including students, claiming to have voted twice, which is a criminal offence.
It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries.
Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote.
A record number of 46.8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election, 500,000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46.4 million figure for the EU referendum.
Of these, 68.7% actually voted on the day, the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997.
There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline.
In total, 2.9 million applications were received over the six-week period.
Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10%, including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury, Cambridge, Bristol West and Leeds Central.
However, concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year's EU referendum - continue to persist.
At the moment, there is no direct link between electoral registers, which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain, and the online registration service now used by a majority of people.
The two systems use different databases and cannot communicate directly with each other.
Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline, about 4.9 million applications to vote were submitted, the majority of them done online.
But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1.4 million, suggesting ""a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates"".
With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered, the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30% and 70% in different areas.
The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites, including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland.
Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May's local council elections, the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed.
""The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service, in comparison to the difficult of contacting a local authority electoral services team by telephone or email to check if they were already registered, meant many people simply submitted another application,"" the report said.
Although there was a lack of evidence to back up claims on social media that some people had voted twice, the watchdog said it took the issue very seriously and anyone with information should contact the police.
It stressed that although some people - including students and those with second homes - may lawfully be able to register in more than one constituency and cast more than one vote in local elections, voting twice in a general election was an offence punishable by an unlimited fine.
The ""dispersed and unconnected"" nature of the 381 electoral registers in Britain means it is not possible to collectively cross-check entries, the watchdog said, and being able to do so would significantly reduce the risk of double voting.
It is also calling for people who are registered in two seats to choose in advance which one they will vote in at future general elections.
Labour's shadow minister for voter engagement, Cat Smith, said voting twice was a serious offence and police needed to have the resources to prosecute people suspected of doing so.
But she warned against a knee-jerk reaction, given the rise in registration and turnout, particularly among younger voters.
""A blanket ban on being registered at two addresses would exclude those who for reasons of work or study need to be registered in two places,"" she said. ""This cannot be an attempt to make it harder for young people and students to register to vote.""","Reports of people voting more than once in June's election are ""troubling"" but there is little evidence of widespread abuse, the elections watchdog has said.",40630842
"College baseball player Christopher Lane, 22, was shot in the back in the town of Duncan on Friday.
Police said one of the accused admitted Lane was killed for ""the fun of it"".
Chancey Luna, 16, and James Edwards, 15, were charged with first-degree murder; Michael Dewayne Jones, 17, has been named as accessory to the crime.
Lane, from Melbourne, had been visiting his girlfriend's family in Duncan. He was entering his final year at East Central University in the city of Ada, some 85 miles (137km) east of the town.
Because of the severity of their alleged crime, all three of the accused will be tried in adult court.
At Tuesday's hearing, Michael Dewayne Jones cried after he tried to speak about the incident but was cut short by the judge, who said the facts of the case would be determined at another hearing.
Bail for him was set at $1m (Â£640,000). The two younger accused were denied bail.
Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford told local television on Monday that one suspect had said Lane was killed at random.
""They saw Christopher go by, and one of them said, 'there's our target,'"" Chief Ford said.
""The boy who has talked to us said, 'we were bored and didn't have anything to do, so we decided to kill somebody.'""
Mr Ford said they followed Lane in a car and shot him once in the back before driving off.
Witnesses rushed to help Lane after seeing him collapse on the road in Duncan, which has about 24,000 residents.
Family and friends in the US and Australia have been mourning him.
His American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, wept as she laid a cross by a memorial in Duncan at the spot where he was shot.
Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported that roses and a baseball were placed on the home plate where Lane played baseball as a boy in a suburb of the city.
It was accompanied by a message that read: ""A wonderful young man taken too soon. Why?""
The victim's father, Peter Lane, said there was no explanation for his son's death.
""It is heartless and to try to understand it is a short way to insanity,"" he told Australia's Sky News.
The mother of one of the accused was quoted by Australian broadcaster ABC News as saying that she could not believe her son was at fault.
""I get off work at three,"" she said. ""It takes me five minutes to get home and he was there. That's what time they said it happened.""",Three Oklahoma teenagers have been charged in the death of an Australian who was gunned down in broad daylight as he jogged on a road in the US state.,23771858
"Cerberus bought the loan portfolio for £1.3bn in 2014.
It paid a £15m ""success fee"" to the Brown Rudnick law firm for work it had done on the portfolio.
Brown Rudnick also claimed it could help Cerberus ""position itself effectively with key stakeholders"".
Cerberus chief operating officer Mark Neporent said Brown Rudnick claimed that they could get access to the executive via the Belfast law firm Tughans.
""They told us they could get us access to other stakeholders... the Northern Ireland Executive, people in the Republic,"" he said.
Mr Neporent is giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in Dublin.
Cerberus agreed to hire Brown Rudnick on 24 March 2014 and on 25 March the Cerberus chairman Dan Quayle met First Minister Peter Robinson at Stormont.
Mr Neporent agreed with committee member Mary Lou McDonald that Brown Rudnick ""were as good as their word""  in getting access.
Nama, an Irish state agency, was established in 2009 to take control of billions of euro of bad property loans which were damaging the Irish banks.
Controversy has surrounded the sales process.
Brown Rudnick and Tughans had previously been working with another fund, Pimco, which was bidding for the portfolio.
Pimco withdrew from the bidding process when it emerged that its fee arrangement with the firms was to involve a payment to Frank Cushnahan, a former Nama advisor.
Cerberus then engaged Brown Rudnick on what it terms ""a success fee only basis"", meaning a fee would only be paid if the deal was done.
Brown Rudnick agreed to share the success fee with Tughans.
Cerberus said it received ""express confirmation"" from both firms that no fee or commission was payable to any current or former Nama advisors.","The investment fund which bought Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio was told by a law firm that it could get them ""access"" to the NI Executive, an Irish parliamentary committee has heard.",38017180
"The city in western Germany is putting 2,500 police officers on the streets for the week-long event.
Germany was shocked by the New Year assaults, largely blamed on migrants. More than 100 women were victims, but the full scale only emerged later.
Separately, police have arrested three suspected Islamist militants in raids.
Cologne sex attacks: Women describe 'terrible' assaults
The raids on flats and offices took place on Thursday in Berlin, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia.
The two men and one woman detained are among four suspected of links to the so-called Islamic State group.
One of those held was being sought by Algerian authorities, and they may have been planning an attack in Germany, police said.
The New Year unrest in Cologne fuelled German unease about a huge influx of asylum seekers.
Two men - a Tunisian and a Moroccan - have been charged over the Cologne offences.
But in total there were 945 complaints to Cologne police after the New Year trouble, 559 of them allegations of sexual assault. Thirty-five suspects are being investigated.
German authorities spoke of a new type of crime, in which gangs of drunken men - described as North African - targeted women.
Cologne resident Miriam was attacked as she and a friend made her way home on New Year's Eve.
She said she was going to the carnival celebrations ""but with really mixed feelings"".
""I'm wondering if something like that could happen again.""
Miriam's mother, Jozi, said the incident changed the way she sees migrants.
""We live in a multicultural area with lots of Moroccans, I've never had a second thought before - we're friends, we greet each other, talk to each other. It was all fine. But now I'm looking at it with different eyes.""
Organisers have not said how many people have attended this year's carnival, but correspondents say the numbers are much lower than in previous years.
Police will be present at a new ""Security Point"" for women near Cologne Cathedral - the area where most of the assaults took place during New Year celebrations.
Police have been trialling ""body cams"" which can film suspects during incidents.
German authorities have also brought in British face recognition experts to help identify those involve in the attacks on New Year's Eve.
Known as ""super-recognisers"", the officers from the London Metropolitan Police can recognise up to 95% of the faces they have seen - compared to about 20% for most people.
Migration to Germany from outside the EU soared to a record 1.1 million last year.

"The idea of the UK paying for tariff-free access to the EU's internal market has been mooted in recent days.
The foreign secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the question of whether the UK would pay anything at all was ""pure speculation"", but if it did, any payments had to be ""sensible"".
Critics say leaving the single market would be an ""act of self-harm"".
Former Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said remaining in the single market of 500 million customers was the ""least economically disruptive form of Brexit"", and, in return for this, the UK should be granted powers for an ""emergency brake"" on migration from the EU.
Negotiations on the terms of exit from the EU will not officially begin until the UK begins the Article 50 process - which Theresa May has said will happen by the end of March.
Pressed on suggestions by his cabinet colleague, the Brexit secretary David Davis, that the UK could pay for tariff-free access to the single market, Mr Johnson - who was a prominent Leave campaigner - said he was not ""going to get into the minutiae"" before negotiations began.
Analysis by Ellie Price, BBC political correspondent
He talked a lot in the EU referendum campaign about taking back control. Now Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is keen to show he hasn't changed his tune.
But he seems to be singing from a slightly different song sheet to that his cabinet colleague, Brexit Secretary David Davis. On Thursday, Mr Davis suggested the government would consider paying the EU to maintain access to the single market.
Boris Johnson said no decision had been taken, and he seemed to favour more limited payments to the EU, including student exchanges and research programmes.
Labour say Britain's membership of the single market is crucial and will define the difference between a so-called hard or soft Brexit.
""That is something that obviously David Davis is considering. It doesn't mean that a decision has been taken,"" he said.
The EU, he insisted, wanted a ""partnership"" with the UK and that would involve a degree of mutual co-operation, for instance the UK continuing to partly funding the Erasmus education exchange scheme.
But he hinted that this would not extend to actually paying to get access to the single market without any penalties or extra levies.
""I have given you an indication of the kind of payments that I think might be sensible,"" he told Andrew Marr.
""My own view is that I see no reason why those payments should be large. And I do see a big opportunity for us to spend the money we are getting back on other priorities.""
The government has yet to set out its negotiating objectives in detail but ministers are coming under growing pressure to avoid a so-called ""hard Brexit"" - a term coined by Remain supporters to describe what they say would be the impact of the UK giving up its membership of the single market
Brexit supporters say continued membership of the single market is only possible if the UK continues to accept rules on the free movement of EU citizens and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice - which they say is unacceptable.
Mr Johnson said Brexit presented the chance to ""take back control of our borders, to take back control of quite large sums of money, not to be run by the European Court - so not to have EU law in this country, and fourthly... to be able to do free trade deals"".
The EU is under pressure in many quarters to drive a hard bargain with the UK but Mr Johnson dismissed suggestions the UK would be punished for voting out.
""It may get pretty hairy at times and there may be some difficult bits, but beneath it all there is a massive fondness for the UK and a desire to do the best possible deal.""
And in a separate interview with ITV's Peston on Sunday, he said foreign students should not be included in the official migration statistics - a view that contradicts current government policy.
Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said the choice was between an ""isolated, hard Brexit and a collaborative, co-operative Brexit"" and while Labour would not stand in the way of triggering Article 50, he said it would oppose a deal which resulted in an ""arms-length"" relationship with the single market.
Mr Clegg, now Lib Dem EU spokesman, told the BBC's Sunday Politics he would oppose Brexit unless single market membership and a referendum on the final deal were guaranteed.","The UK should not have to pay ""large"" sums to the EU to trade with it after Brexit, Boris Johnson has said.",38200112
"A review into the murder of Rhys Jones, who was killed by a man released five days earlier, questioned whether his killer's risk to the public should have been reassessed.
But Mr Jones' family were initially blocked from reading it.
Plans to transfer the management of such reviews to HM Probation have been put on hold.
Mr Jones, 36, who had schizophrenia and had been under the care of mental health services for much of his life, was stabbed to death by Rhys Barnes in November 2015 at the Solas supported housing hostel where they were living in Newport.
Barnes, 28, who had 17 previous convictions for 41 separate offences including grievous bodily harm, assault and carrying offensive weapons, was jailed for life in March 2016.
At the time of the killing he was being supervised by the National Probation Service after his release from prison, having been assessed as a high risk to his family and a medium risk to the public.
He had been readmitted to prison at the beginning of November for breaching supervision conditions, but five days after coming out, he murdered Rhys Jones following a row about a girlfriend.
A review into the killing questioned whether Barnes' level of risk to the general public should have been reassessed, and whether a multi-agency public protection meeting should have been held.
The report said staff should consider referring prisoners who breach their licence conditions to a probation-approved premises following re-release.
The findings of the review were shared with staff across Wales, ""to highlight areas of learning so that staff across the organisation can embed the learning into their own practice"".
But Mr Jones' family had to push to see it after they claim they were initially told it ""would not benefit"" them to know the findings.
David Hanson, Labour MP for Delyn and a member of the justice select committee in Westminster, said it was important families and the public know what went wrong in cases such as these.
""That means that the report has to be published for the victim, but also for those like myself who take an interest to make sure the system is working well,"" he said.
""Without that we think something may well be hidden and something may not be dealt with that could be dealt with.""
Labour's Newport East AM John Griffiths, who had been supporting Mr Jones' family, echoed his call.
""I would pay tribute to Rhys' family because they've shown dogged determination to try and ensure that the whole of the circumstances are understood, and that lessons are learnt for the future, crucially, to try and minimise the chances of further tragic loss of life in these sorts of circumstances,"" he said.
""The more openness the better, for public confidence; if people feel things are being hidden that arouses suspicions and concern.""
Tania Bassett, of the National Association of Probation Officers, called on the government to honour its pledge to transfer management of serious further offence reviews from the probation service to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Probation.
She said: ""We welcome that [the transfer] because it would apply a much more consistent approach across the board: everyone would have the same treatment, it would be an external independent body looking at that investigation rather than those who may have their own commercial interests, and also it would mean greater transparency for the public, which we think is the right way forward.""
The National Probation Service said: ""Serious further offences such as this [Mr Jones's murder] are rare but each one is taken extremely seriously and investigated fully.
""Public protection is our priority. A full review was undertaken and all identified learning was taken forward.""
Nick Taylor, of Solas Cymru, said an internal hostel review of Mr Jones' killing found there was ""absolutely no way that this incident could have been predicted"".","Inquiries into serious crimes committed by recently-released prisoners should be published, politicians have said.",39171535
"After their engine failed and their anchor was lost off the coast of India's Andhra Pradesh state in June last year, the men were left stranded in dangerous waters.
They drifted helplessly for a week in the Bay of Bengal until an oil tanker under the command of Capt Menon came to their rescue.
Her efforts have now been recognised with the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Award for Exceptional Bravery at Sea, handed out in London on Monday.
Not only is Capt Menon the first female captain in the Indian Merchant Navy, but she is the only woman to have won the award, which recognises those who risk their own lives to save others at sea.
As waves rose to 9m and wind speed reached 60-70 knots, she commanded a rescue operation last June that required three attempts to get the fishermen onboard the massive tanker via a pilot ladder from their small boat.
The Sampurna Swarajya tanker's second officer had earlier spotted the fishing boat 2.5km away off the coast of Gopalpur in Orissa. The men had been surviving off ice from their cold storage after food and drinking supplies were washed away.
""The sea was very, very turbulent, there was a depression... which was stagnant for two or three days and it had intensified into a deep depression,"" Capt Menon told BBC World News TV.
""It was a very difficult task but we had to do it because if I didn't do that I was knowing very well that these fishermen never stood a chance of rescue, no survival at all.""

Flanker James Haskell, lock Maro Itoje, winger Anthony Watson, back rower Jack Clifford and winger Jack Nowell all return for the champions after injury.
""We are looking forward to being daring in our [first] game against France on 4 February,"" said head coach Eddie Jones.
England are without a number of players through injury, including both Mako and Billy Vunipola and former captain Chris Robshaw.
Of those players in the squad, the likes of Haskell, Anthony Watson, Joe Launchbury and George Kruis have either just returned from injuries or are still fighting their way back to full fitness.
The experienced Tom Wood retains his place after a fine November series, while lock Charlie Ewels, prop Kyle Sinckler and hooker Tommy Taylor have just a handful of caps between them.
England go into the tournament as defending champions having won the Grand Slam in 2016, and on the back of a 14-game winning streak, equalling the record set by Sir Clive Woodward's side in the build-up to the 2003 World Cup.

""Obviously I've been pleased with how the team's progressing, but there's still plenty to improve on.
""At the start of last year's Six Nations I probably didn't realise the enormity of the tournament and how intense the rivalry is between the countries, so this year we'll be better prepared for it.""

"The move will see the supermarket open Giraffe branches near to Tesco stores as it seeks to create ""retail destinations"" for customers.
Tesco will hope that the acquisition will help revitalise its UK business.
Over the past year, the group has been revamping its UK stores. In January, it reported its strongest growth in UK Christmas sales for three years, but said there was ""a lot more to do"".
Tesco pointed to Giraffe's popularity with a wide range of ages, particularly families, as part of its appeal.
""We think our customers will love it,"" said group commercial director Kevin Grace.
The supermarket recently bought a 49% stake in Harris and Hoole coffee shops, a move which drew criticism from some shoppers who felt they had been duped into believing it was an independent business. It has also invested in the Euphorium Bakery chain.
""I think it's a very significant move,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of Conlumino told BBC News.
""Traditional retailing is seeing much more sluggish growth and one of the things that all retailers have got to do is look to wider areas of spending including leisure and dining out.
""[This] exposes Tesco to much more lucrative growth.""
Analysts also suggested that the move could help Tesco solve a crucial problem: what to do with the retail space that was once devoted to things like CDs and movies.
Tesco can ""implant Giraffe restaurants into its larger stores where it has an excess of retail space,"" said UBS food retail analyst Mike Tattersall.
Giraffe founders Russel and Juliette Joffe and Andrew Jacobs will remain in place on the management team, with Russel Joffe continuing as managing director.

"Speaking after talks with his Turkish counterpart in Ankara, the UK prime minister said Islamic State (IS) was a ""common enemy"" that must be confronted.
He hailed the countries' existing intelligence co-operation and said this would be stepped up further.
The US and EU want Turkey to take a more active role in tackling IS.
At a press conference in the capital, Turkey's prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the two countries shared a ""strong and common political will"" to address the threat posed by foreign fighters travelling to and from conflict zones in Syria and Iraq.
Mr Cameron said that British jihadists had ""sometimes"" passed through Turkey and the two men had had ""productive discussions"" over how they could be detained and, if possible, prosecuted.
The UK government is seeking greater powers to confiscate the passports of people returning to the UK from Iraq and Syria who are thought to pose a threat to national security, with Parliament currently debating changes to the law.
Asked whether Turkey could be doing more to identify and stop suspects at its borders, Mr Cameron said the two countries were already working ""as closely as we possibly can"" to tackle the threat.
He said: ""Whether it is about stopping people coming through Turkey to Syria or Iraq to fight for Islamic State, whether it's about making sure we deal with people when they return, whether it is the highest levels of intelligence co-operation that we can possibly achieve between our countries, this is all about making sure people are safer in Turkey and making sure people are safer back home in the UK.""
As well as addressing the ""extremist ideology"" that fuels Islamic State, he reiterated his calls for a transition to a more democratic and representative government in Syria and more efforts towards reconciliation by the new government in Baghdad.
Mr Cameron also hailed a growth in economic links between the UK and Turkey, saying bilateral trade had increased by 60% since 2010.

"Scientists at Imperial College London examined the bone structure of hip-fracture patients who had been treated with bisphosphonates.
They found evidence the drugs were linked to microscopic cracks, making bones more fragile and prone to break.
Osteoporosis affects three million people in the UK.
What is osteoporosis?
Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures.
Bisphosphonates - the main treatment for osteoporosis - are an extremely successful and commonly prescribed class of drugs that slow down the natural processes by which the body removes ageing or damaged bone.
But doctors have raised concerns about the number of fractures occurring among elderly patients who have been taking the drugs for a long time.
To find out why, the team led by Dr Richie Abel took samples of bone from 16 hip-fracture patients and studied them at the Diamond Light Source - the massive doughnut-shaped Syncatron or particle accelerator at the Harwell campus in south Oxfordshire.
""What we wanted to see was whether the bone from bisphosphonate patients was weaker or stronger than bone from untreated controls,"" Dr Abel explained.
""Rather startlingly, we found the bone from the bisphosphonate patients was weaker. That's a conundrum because the bone should be stronger.""
By bombarding the samples with X-rays 10 billion times brighter than the Sun, the team were able to generate images of the internal structure of the bones in unprecedented detail.
These showed microscopic cracks building up in the bones of patients treated with bisphosphonates.
Dr Abel said: ""The drug is clearly working, but it also leads to the build-up of micro-cracks in the bone and that could increase the likelihood of a fracture.""
It's a surprising result, but the study was small and the work is at an early stage.
Even so, Prof Justin Cobb, a co-author on the paper, says the discovery raises important questions about how we prescribe bisphosphonates for long-term conditions such as osteoporosis.
""There's no hurry, but we should think about how long people are taking them for, and how we might monitor the development of these micro-cracks,"" he said.
In the meantime the researchers say people should continue to take medications prescribed by their doctor.
If you answered: ""Yes,"" to more than one of these questions, then you may be more at risk of developing osteoporosis:
•Has anyone in your family ever been diagnosed with osteoporosis?
•Have you ever broken a bone after a minor bump or fall?
•Are you female and aged over 50?
•Do you drink more than three units of alcohol a day?
•Do you miss out on summer sunlight (through being housebound, avoiding the sun, always covering your skin or wearing sunscreen)?
•Do you miss out on doing at least 30 minutes of activity five times a week?

"More than 260 children had been left at the welfare home in Guangzhou since 28 January, director Xu Jiu added.
Staff will continue caring for babies already at the welfare home, all of whom suffer from illnesses, Mr Xu said.
China introduced the centres so parents could abandon infants safely rather than leaving them in the streets.
Supporters say the baby hatches save lives, but critics say they encourage parents to abandon their children.
Mr Xu announced the suspension on Sunday, saying that 262 babies had been left at the centre since the scheme began in January.
""I hope everyone understands the difficulties the welfare centre faces,"" Mr Xu told Xinhua news agency.
""We are temporarily closing the centre [to new babies] so that we can properly care for the infants already at the centre.""
The centre, which also cares for orphans, has 1,000 beds.
However, it currently houses 1,121 babies and young people, with another 1,274 in the care of foster families, Guangzhou's Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau said.
All the abandoned infants had illnesses, such as cerebral palsy, Down's syndrome and congenital heart disease, the bureau added.
It is thought that many parents abandon ill babies because they fear they cannot afford the medical care required.
Abandoning children is illegal in China. However, authorities believe that the hatches give the infants a better chance of survival than if they were left in the street.
A total of 25 baby hatches have been established in 10 provincial regions in China, Xinhua reports.
Under China's strict population control policies, most couples have only been allowed to have one child and there is a strong preference for healthy baby boys.

"Mr McKelvie said he left after being told he may be required as a witness during the inquiry's investigations.
His information had led to Labour MP Tom Watson raising concerns over whether a minister had links to a past paedophile ring.
It was later reported that the police had found no evidence for such a claim.
The IICSA inquiry, sparked by claims of paedophiles operating in Westminster in the 1980s, will investigate whether ""state and non-state institutions have failed in their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation"" in England and Wales.
Mr McKelvie said he had ""reluctantly"" resigned after being ""advised that I am likely to be required as a witness in the inquiry's investigations, and that the inquiry may need to examine my work in pursuing allegations of [child sexual abuse]"".
Justice Lowell Goddard, who is leading IICSA, thanked Mr McKelvie for his work on the Victims and Survivors Consultative Panel.
She added: ""I would also like to take this opportunity to stress that allegations concerning child sexual abuse related to Westminster are only one component of the inquiry's work.
""As I said in my opening statement the inquiry's terms of reference go far broader than this and encompass all institutions within England and Wales. This important work continues.""
The BBC reported on Thursday that emails unearthed by the BBC's Panorama programme showed detectives dismissed the allegations made by Mr Watson in October 2012, two months after the Commons statement.
The files on which Mr Watson based his statement were seized as part of an investigation involving Mr McKelvie, into the paedophile ring centred on senior social worker Peter Righton in the early 1990s.
Mr Watson was briefed on their content, before making his statement, by Mr McKelvie.
Mr McKelvie has told the BBC he did not claim to Mr Watson that there had been a ""Westminster paedophile ring"" and pointed out that the police investigations which followed the Commons statement had led to convictions of two men who were part of the original paedophile ring.
It also emerged on Thursday that child sex abuse victims have been asked to resubmit information to the inquiry after it was accidentally deleted.

"A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated.
He broke company policy by using a work account to talk to his family.
In response, bodies representing directors and workers, as well as privacy and human resources groups, all issued similar warnings to bosses.
The European Trades Union Congress, which represents workers across the continent, said the judges' decision should not act as a ""green lightâ€¦ to start snooping"" on staff.
The case in the European Court of Human Rights did not introduce any new rules, but acted as a stress test for those that already allowed similar surveillance by employers in some circumstances.
Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said: ""Employees should not be subject to Stasi-style surveillance at work.
""We would strongly urge businesses not to read an employee's personal messages, apart from in the most exceptional circumstances.""
British Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Big Brother bosses do not get the best out of employees.
""Staff who are being snooped on are less productive and less healthy"".
And the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: ""Employees that feel under excessive surveillance are also more likely to suffer from stress, so there needs to be a clear case for monitoring.""
They were joined by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, which said: ""None of us should ever assume that what we do online during work hours or when using devices owned by our employer, such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, is private - but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss.""
The judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu.
Mr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said.
The company had also banned private use of the internet at work.
When confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found.
And the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive.
Mr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him.
The court's decision does not introduce new measures.
Reading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK.
Rather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life.
The judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable.
If the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision.
Others, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case.
The effect on domestic courts is different.
Each country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions.
In the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed.
Moreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances.
One of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance.
The case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights.
So, avoiding those would be a good start.
In the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary.
Essex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: ""Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking.
""It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal.
""Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi.""
Apps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security.
Broadly, ""the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation"", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little.
But some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC.
The banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to ""take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications"" on company equipment.
FCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment.
According to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.",Bosses have been urged not to indulge in invasive surveillance by reading their employees' private messages.,35314038
"The medicine does not contain the ingredient that produces the high associated with recreational cannabis.
The treatment, called Epidiolex, is based on one of the non-psychoactive components of the cannabis plant, CBD.
Early studies in the US have shown treatment with CBD may reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in children with severe forms of epilepsy.
The new trial marks the first time the treatment has been tested in the UK.
Patients are being enrolled for a trial of the treatment at Edinburgh University's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, based at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and Great Ormond Street Hospital.
The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool are also driving the study.
There are further centres in the US, France and Poland.
Their initial focus will be on children with Dravet Syndrome, a rare but serious type of epilepsy that is difficult to treat. Some children will receive the treatment while others will receive a placebo.
In a further phase, researchers will also study the effect on children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.
Only children whose seizures cannot be controlled with existing medications will take part in the trial.
Dravet Syndrome usually takes hold in the first year of life. It causes seizures that are often prolonged, lasting longer than five minutes.
They then develop other seizure types. This has a significant impact on the child's development and can be fatal in some cases.
Epidiolex has been developed by the British biotechnology company GW Pharmaceuticals, which is sponsoring and funding the trial.

Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for North East Scotland, Alison McInnes, said ""real support"" was needed from the UK government if the North Sea oil and gas industry were to overcome the challenges it faced.
Maggie Chapman, Scottish Greens spokeswoman on social justice, said the ""need for a plan to transition the Scottish economy away from dependence on fossil fuels"" had become ""ever more important"".
John Boland, from trade union Unite, said: ""This morning's announcement shows the crisis which has gripped our oil and gas sector for over a year now is far from over.  It's another hammer blow for jobs and skills.
""We need an emergency convention of all the industry stakeholders - government, employers and trade unions - to tackle this crisis so we have a safe and sustainable industry for the next generation.""
Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: ""This is very disappointing news and a sign of the continued difficulties facing the sector, but we welcome the commitment from BP that the company still sees a long-term future in this area and is continuing to invest heavily in the North Sea.""
Industry body Oil and Gas UK said the plummeting oil price had impacted heavily on activity across the UK Continental Shelf.
Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: ""While Oil and Gas UK cannot comment on the commercial decisions made by its members, companies are having to take very difficult decisions in what continues to be a challenging time, and we, as an industry, must be thoughtful and supportive of our colleagues who are being made redundant or facing uncertainty.""",BP has announced plans to shed about 600 jobs from its operations in the North Sea.,35291874

"From 2010 until mid-2014, world oil prices had been fairly stable, at around $110 a barrel. But since June prices have more than halved. Brent crude oil has now dipped below $50 a barrel for the first time since May 2009 and US crude is down to below $48 a barrel.
The reasons for this change are twofold - weak demand in many countries due to insipid economic growth, coupled with surging US production.
Added to this is the fact that the oil cartel Opec is determined not to cut production as a way to prop up prices.
So who are some of the winners and losers?
Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers, and its dramatic interest rate hike to 17% in support of its troubled rouble underscores how heavily its economy depends on energy revenues, with oil and gas accounting for 70% of export incomes.
Russia loses about $2bn in revenues for every dollar fall in the oil price, and the World Bank has warned that Russia's economy would shrink by at least 0.7% in 2015 if oil prices do not recover.
Despite this, Russia has confirmed it will not cut production to shore up oil prices.
""If we cut, the importer countries will increase their production and this will mean a loss of our niche market,"" said Energy Minister Alexander Novak.
Falling oil prices, coupled with western sanctions over Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine have hit the country hard.
The government has cut its growth forecast for 2015, predicting that the economy will sink into recession.
Former finance minister, Alexei Kudrin, said the currency's fall was not just a reaction to lower oil prices and western sanctions, ""but also [a show of] distrust to the economic policies of the government"".
Given the pressures facing Moscow now, some economists expect further measures to shore up the currency.
""We think capital controls as a policy measure cannot be off the table now,"" said Luis Costa, a senior analyst at Citi.
While President Putin is not using the word ""crisis"", Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has been more forthright on Russia's economic problems.
""Frankly, we, strictly speaking, have not fully recovered from the crisis of 2008,"" he said in a recent interview.
Because of the twin impact of falling oil prices and sanctions, he said the government had had to cut spending. ""We had to abandon a number of programmes and make certain sacrifices.""
Russia's interest rate rise may also bring its own problems, as high rates can choke economic growth by making it harder for businesses to borrow and spend.
Venezuela is one of the world's largest oil exporters, but thanks to economic mismanagement it was already finding it difficult to pay its way even before the oil price started falling.
Inflation is running at about 60% and the economy is teetering on the brink of recession. The need for spending cuts is clear, but the government faces difficult choices.
The country already has some of the world's cheapest petrol prices - fuel subsidies cost Caracas about $12.5bn a year - but President Maduro has ruled out subsidy cuts and higher petrol prices.
""I've considered as head of state, that the moment has not arrived,"" he said. ""There's no rush, we're not going to throw more gasoline on the fire that already exists with speculation and induced inflation.""
The government's caution is understandable. A petrol price rise in 1989 saw widespread riots that left hundreds dead.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and Opec's most influential member, could support global oil prices by cutting back its own production, but there is little sign it wants to do this.
There could be two reasons - to try to instil some discipline among fellow Opec oil producers, and perhaps to put the US's burgeoning shale oil and gas industry under pressure.
Although Saudi Arabia needs oil prices to be around $85 in the longer term, it has deep pockets with a reserve fund of some $700bn - so can withstand lower prices for some time.
""In terms of production and pricing of oil by Middle East producers, they are beginning to recognise the challenge of US production,"" says Robin Mills, Manaar Energy's head of consulting.
If a period of lower prices were to force some higher cost producers to shut down, then Riyadh might hope to pick up market share in the longer run.
However, there is also recent history behind Riyadh's unwillingness to cut production. In the 1980s the country did cut production significantly in a bid to boost prices, but it had little effect and it also badly affected the Saudi economy.
Alongside Saudi Arabia, Gulf producers such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have also amassed considerable foreign currency reserves, which means that they could run deficits for several years if necessary.
Other Opec members such as Iran, Iraq and Nigeria, with greater domestic budgetary demands because of their large population sizes in relation to their oil revenues, have less room for manoeuvre.
They have combined foreign currency reserves of less than $200bn, and are already under pressure from increased US competition.
Nigeria, which is Africa's biggest oil producer, has seen growth in the rest of its economy but despite this it remains heavily oil-dependent. Energy sales account for up to 80% of all government revenue and more than 90% of the country's exports.
The war in Syria and Iraq has also seen Isis, or Islamic State, capturing oil wells. It is estimated it is making about $3m a day through black market sales - and undercutting market prices by selling at a significant discount - around $30-60 a barrel.
""The growth of oil production in North America, particularly in the US, has been staggering,"" says Columbia University's Jason Bordoff.
Speaking to BBC World Service's World Business Report, he said that US oil production levels were at their highest in almost 30 years.
It has been this growth in US energy production, where gas and oil is extracted from shale formations using hydraulic fracturing or fracking, that has been one of the main drivers of lower oil prices.
""Shale has essentially severed the linkage between geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, and oil price and equities,"" says Seth Kleinman, head of energy strategy at Citi.
Even though many US shale oil producers have far higher costs than conventional rivals, many need to carry on pumping to generate at least some revenue stream to pay off debts and other costs.
With Europe's flagging economies characterised by low inflation and weak growth, any benefits of lower prices would be welcomed by beleaguered governments.
A 10% fall in oil prices should lead to a 0.1% increase in economic output, say some. In general consumers benefit through lower energy prices, but eventually low oil prices do erode the conditions that brought them about.
China, which is set to become the largest net importer of oil, should gain from falling prices. However, lower oil prices won't fully offset the far wider effects of a slowing economy.
Japan imports nearly all of the oil it uses. But lower prices are a mixed blessing because high energy prices had helped to push inflation higher, which has been a key part of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's growth strategy to combat deflation.
India imports 75% of its oil, and analysts say falling oil prices will ease its current account deficit. At the same time, the cost of India's fuel subsidies could fall by $2.5bn this year - but only if oil prices stay low.","Global oil prices have fallen sharply over the past seven months, leading to significant revenue shortfalls in many energy exporting nations, while consumers in many importing countries are likely to have to pay less to heat their homes or drive their cars.",29643612

"The venture's backers include Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, Indian tech giant Infosys and Amazon Web Services.
Open AI says it expects its research - free from financial obligations - to focus on a ""positive human impact"".
Scientists have warned that advances in AI could ultimately threaten humanity.
Mr Musk recently told students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that AI was humanity's ""biggest existential threat"".
Last year, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking told the BBC AI could potentially ""re-design itself at an ever increasing rate"", superseding humans by outpacing biological evolution.
However, other experts have argued that the risk of AI posing any threat to humans remains remote.
A statement on OpenAI's website said the venture aims ""to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return"".
""It's hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it's equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly.""
The statement said AI ""should be an extension of individual human wills and, in the spirit of liberty, as broadly and evenly distributed as is possible safely"".

"Named after Japanese sword-smith Muramasa Sengo, the Guernsey-born musician comes armed with deft beats, exotic instrumentation and heartbreaking lyrics.
Like his namesake, he says he wants the music ""to cut like a knife"".
Only 19 years old, he has already created a strong body of original material, incorporating Asian soundscapes (Shakuhachi flutes, thumb pianos) into his glitchy electronica.
His most recent track, Love For That, is a sumptuous, string-drenched ballad which found its way onto the BBC 1Xtra playlist after being played more than a million times on SoundCloud.
The musician, whose real name is Alex Crossan, talked to the BBC from the flatshare in Brighton where he records all of his music.
Congratulations on making the top five Sound of 2016. How does it feel?
Sort of baffling. It's an honour, but it's scary and exciting.
You grew up in Guernsey, which isn't a place that's renowned for cutting-edge dance music.
There was a footballer, Matt Le Tissier, from Guernsey. But as far as music, no, not many people have come out of there.
Did that sense of isolation from the music scene help you develop your own sound?
I think so. If you grew up in London's East End you'd probably be inclined to be into something like grime music. But if you're removed from it, like in Guernsey, you can have a wider set of influences, and you're not tied down to any genre or any scene. I think that affects my sound, for sure.
What sort of music did you grow up listening to?
At a young age, I was introduced to Joni Mitchell by my mum. My dad was into progressive rock. But when YouTube came around in 2005 or 2006, suddenly all the music was available and you just had to do your own research.
There's a strong oriental theme to your music - how did you work out those sounds and scales and styles of playing?
Just a lot of time and patience, really. A lot of people say they're influenced by things, but they don't actually listen to what's happening in the music.
If you do your homework properly before you try and write it becomes simple.
Did you have musical training?
I started playing violin when I was about five years old and I learned to read a little bit of music, but that's all been long, long forgotten! I actually quit violin to teach myself guitar and just went from there.
Do you remember the first song you produced?
Oh gosh. It was a really, really terrible dubstep track. It had a sample of Robin Williams in it shouting ""Gooooood Morning Vietnam!"" It was awful.
You started uploading music to the internet very quickly. What was the impetus for that?
Because I'm from Guernsey, I couldn't swap music with many people. I had a couple of friends who were making music but I think online was just the natural way for me to get heard. I come from the internet generation, so it kind of made sense. There wasn't any deep thought put into it.
The first track I uploaded was called Death Grips - but it doesn't exist any more. I deleted it because it's so bad!
When did you first realise people were taking notice?
I put out a mix tape at the end of last year called Soundtrack To A Death and it was just a beat tape - but Jo Whiley played it on Radio 2, and then Huw Stephens made it album of the week on Radio 1. It was all very strange.
But I think that was when I started developing my own sound and I think people started tuning in to that.
How would you describe that sound?
Gosh, this is always the question I dread! But it takes everything that I love about hip-hop and electronic music and mashes it together in the setting of lo-fi, oriental-influenced beat music.
Is the flute part in Lotus Eater a sample?
I wrote that, actually.
That's incredible. It sounds like its come from a dusty old piece of vinyl.
That's what's great about it, I think, because you can write a part and retroactively make it lo-fi and make it sound like a sample. That's something I love doing.
That song would fit perfectly on a film soundtrack - specifically a Quentin Tarantino film. Do you approach music visually?
For definite. I didn't start writing my debut album until I'd sorted the cover art. It's an intrinsic part of the whole process. The first music I really loved was Gorillaz and I think the way the visuals played into the music and told a story was very important to me.
It's funny you should mention Tarantino. I have two posters in my room - one's of the White Stripes and the other one is Pulp Fiction.
The strings on Love For That really emphasise the emotions of the song. Are they live instruments?
Yeah they are - and I think I'm going to be doing that a lot more on the album. It just makes it quite special hearing the bow moving on the strings.
It's cool to make people remember that, although electronic music is obviously produced electronically, it's still real music.
Your album is due out in the first couple of months of 2016. Is it finished?
I'm about half-way done. The way I work, everything tends to come together last minute. It's called To Fall Out Of Love To and it's got a story arc to it.
Is it a concept album?
Ermâ€¦ yeah. But to me, whenever I hear the words ""concept album"", it means the music isn't that good but there's a really cool idea behind it. I want to hit the target of really good music and really meaningful lyrical content.
You've already been played on daytime radio - is the ambition to crossover into the mainstream?
If you go into this expecting a number one single then you're a pop artist - and I don't think I am a pop artistâ€¦ yet.
At the end of the day, my personal ambition is just to make really, really, really good music that's culturally relevant and stands the test of time. That's all I want.",Bedroom pop artist Mura Masa has come joint fifth in the BBC Music Sound of 2016 with R&B group WSTRN.,35167132

"We got a foretaste a couple of weeks ago when Europe Minister David Lidington delivered a Commons statement on the government's demands for a renegotiation of Britain's EU membership.
The reaction from the hard core of backbench ""outers"" was summed up by Bernard Jenkin's dismissive comment, ""Is that it?""
The government's promised in-out EU referendum was a vote-winner at the election, and probably essential to keep the lid on Tory euro-tension in the last parliament. But as the 2017 deadline appears on the horizon, it is prompting some Commons Tories to murmur of a ""Corn Laws-style split"" in the party.
Of course, historically, the Conservative Party has always been able to rely on a powerful instinct for unity, born of an equally powerful instinct for power.
But party history offers some warnings too. Issues that go to the heart of what the Conservative party is about can split it, and have split it.
In the 1840s, it was agricultural protection and the move to abandon the Corn Laws which protected the incomes of landowners.
In the 1900s, it was imperial protection and the idea of moving away from free trade to a customs union with the countries of the Empire.
And ever since the UK joined the EU, a growing - possibly now a majority - faction of the party has wanted out.
Those splits destroyed Tory governments - conjure up the ghosts of Robert Peel or AJ Balfour, ask John Major about his cabinet rebels - and recall that party management has never been David Cameron's strongest suit.
Next time, the dynamics of the promised referendum suggest that it could pull the Conservative party apart again.
The scenario works like this: polling suggests that, without substantial change in the UK's membership terms, the British public will vote to leave the EU - with immigration a particularly crucial area.
But most people will not assess the small print setting out changes to an intricate and little understood institutional structure.
Instead, they will look to figures they trust to tell them whether enough has changed. And in particular, that means Mr Cameron.
His will be the crucial voice in any effort to persuade the voters that he has delivered acceptable terms. This week's tough talking to other EU leaders on benefits for EU citizens is a public display of political hardball, for UK consumption, as well as an attempt to underline his determination.
But, assuming he does campaign to keep the UK inside the EU, the referendum will turn on how voters react when he says to them, ""Trust Me.""
The ""out"" side of the argument will have no option but to attack his personal credibility. Tory toes are already creeping across this line.
If you listen carefully to interviews by some ""outers"", they praise his past successes and talk about how his place in history has been secured by his victory in May. It's a subtle point, but what they're not doing is banging the normal party gong and hoping he will rule forever. And soon they will go further than that.
And for the prime minister and his heir-presumptive, Chancellor George Osborne, if they do - as seems almost certain - campaign to maintain British membership, the referendum will become a struggle for survival.
Whatever they say, the idea that they could campaign to stay in, then, after a vote to leave, pick themselves up, dust themselves down and negotiate the terms of a so-called Brexit, is met with frank incredulity.
In the anti-EU ranks they are quite clear - if their team wins, they'll hoist the trophy, run the victory lap and provide the captain.
Combine the certainty of attacks on the PM's personal credibility with the struggle for factional survival that's facing the current magic circle of the Conservative Party, and you have a sinister brew of malice and ambition certain to corrode Tory unity.
The more so if Labour is languishing in the polls with problems of its own.
Expect purges and punishments to be the order of the day. And whatever the referendum result, we know that there will be a Tory leadership campaign at the back end of this Parliament - into which this poison will seep.
In some ways, the worst-case scenario for Tory unity is a narrow vote to stay.
Scotland does not provide an encouraging precedent - a No to independence by an 11% margin has fed, rather than slain, the SNP.
A tighter result in an EU referendum could allow the ""out"" side to sustain a ""we wuz robbed"" mentality and treat the forthcoming leadership election (Mr Cameron has said he won't serve another term as PM) as a continuation of the referendum by other means.
A Conservative MP reminded me the other day that in 1975 Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson campaigned for and won a mandate to keep Britain in the then EEC in a referendum - but eight years later his party fought a general election on a manifesto commitment to leave.
Parties, he said, can turn on a sixpence when they have to, even if such a handbrake turn can fling some passengers out of the vehicle altogether.
All of which raises the question, as the country staggers towards the 2020 general election, will there, by then, be any functional UK-wide political parties left?","The sheer pyrotechnics of Labour's internal feuding have mesmerised Westminster, but Conservative MPs should not titter too hard at their opponents' discomfort - they have their own civil war brewing.",35007813
"The vote in the St Louis suburb is the first since the death of Michael Brown last August led to protests.
A federal investigation found racial bias in the Ferguson police department was widespread.
Two-thirds of Ferguson's residents are black and now half the council.
Shortly after the results came out, a video emerged showing an unarmed black man being shot dead by a police officer in South Carolina.
State investigators said the officer, Michael Slager, would be charged with murder after the video showed him firing at Walter Lamer Scott who was running away.
Turnout in Ferguson increased from 12% at the last elections, in 2013, to 29%.
Wesley Bell, who defeated another black candidate in Ferguson's third ward, said: ""This community came out in record numbers to make sure our voices were heard.
""When you have a community engaged, the sky is the limit.""
A drive by activists to register new voters and encourage previously disenfranchised residents to vote appeared to have paid off.
""People in general want to see change,"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told the Reuters news agency.
Ella Jones defeated another black candidate and two white candidates in Ferguson's first ward to become the first black woman on the council.
Black residents in Ferguson protested for several days last August after Mr Brown was shot dead by St Louis police officer Darren Wilson.
The protests spread nationwide in November when it was announced that Mr Wilson, who has since left the police, would not be charged.

"The 91-year-old, alongside the firm's former chief financial officer Howard Smith, is accused of engineering bogus transactions to hide the insurance giant's financial difficulties.
Both have denied the allegations.
The charges were filed by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer in 2005, but Mr Greenberg and Mr Smith have fought them, saying they have no merit.
However, the Court of Appeals said there's enough evidence for the trial to proceed.
Current New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he wanted to pursue the case to show ""no one, no matter how rich or powerful, can evade responsibility for misconduct.""
Mr Greenberg's lawyer, David Boies, has said he believes the lawsuit was driven by Mr Spitzer's political motivations.
""This case was brought by Eliot Spitzer expressly because he was angry at Hank Greenberg,"" Mr Boies said.
The trial before Justice Charles Ramos of New York state court in Manhattan, which will take place three days a week, is expected to last for up to six months.
The insurance giant almost collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis.
The firm, which issued credit guarantees for sub-prime mortgages, was bailed out by the US government, which took an 80% stake in the firm and provided nearly $185bn in aid.

"Born to a Jamaican mother and British father, Eric Johnson, 31, moved to the UK from the Caribbean aged four.
The Home Office had been seeking to deport him as a ""foreign criminal"".
The Supreme Court ruled this was discriminatory, saying he would not be removed if his parents had married.
The deportation case came down to ""an accident of birth"" was the view of the five Supreme Court justices on Wednesday.
Lady Hale, who headed the panel, said in a written ruling: ""In this case, what needs to be justified is the current liability of the appellant to be deported when they would not be so liable had their parents been married to one another at any time after their birth.
""That is a present distinction which is based solely on the accident of birth outside wedlock, for which the appellant is not responsible.""
Johnson began his fight with the Home Office in 2011, after being jailed for nine years in 2008.
The justices pointed out that new immigration rules that came in to effect in 2006 gave people in Johnson's position automatic British citizenship at birth, but that the changes had not been applied retrospectively.

"Southampton, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight councils applied to the government in October to create an authority to boost economic growth.
They said they had been allocated £900m over 30 years by the government.
Portsmouth Council leader Donna Jones said the money now appeared to have been lost because of opposition by Hampshire County Council.
Ms Jones said it was ""highly unlikely"" that the government would agree the deal, because ""there isn't consensus"".
The situation was discussed at a meeting at Westminster on Wednesday involving Hampshire MPs and council leaders.
The new Isle of Wight Council leader Dave Stewart said he confirmed to the meeting that his recently-elected Conservative administration would not support the existing bid.
Isle of Wight Conservatives had previously said the island's needs ""could easily be overridden"" by Southampton and Portsmouth.
Hampshire County Council leader Roy Perry said: ""I'm not surprised that the deal is now dead.
""It would not have helped the local economy and would have led to the dismantling of vital county-wide services - such as transport, health and social care.""
Keith House, the leader of Eastleigh Borough Council, which had been in talks to join the Solent Combined Authority (SCA), said the bid was ""almost certainly dead"", but Fareham Borough Council leader Sean Woodward urged the government to ""press ahead"" with the deal.
The Department for Communities and Local Government said devolution applications should be accompanied by ""local support"", but did not say whether the Solent bid had been refused.
The Conservative MP for Havant, Alan Mak, said: ""The money is still very much there.

"The 26-year-old, who has 11 caps, has been on the bench for his club for much of this season.
But he will start ahead of Scotland's four other strikers.
""Am I a bit rusty right now? Yeah, but as a striker you need to be ready whether you're starting the game or coming off the bench,"" said Griffiths.
""The gaffer has kept us on our toes this week with the tempo of training.""
Griffiths scored 40 goals for Celtic last season but was given only 15 minutes of action during the whole of Scotland's failed Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
He had found Sheffield Wednesday's Steven Fletcher, Norwich City's Steven Naismith and Chris Martin, currently on loan at Fulham from Derby County, chosen ahead of him by head coach Gordon Strachan.
And Fletcher's clubmate, Jordan Rhodes, is the only player to be playing regularly for his club at present.
But Griffiths has still managed 14 goals in 33 appearances for Celtic this season despite finding himself second choice behind summer signing Moussa Dembele.
He was given half an hour along with Rhodes as replacements for Naismith and Martin in Wednesday's 1-1 friendly draw with Canada.
Strachan admits that, with the Scots fifth in qualifying Group F, his side must beat the second-placed Slovenians to retain hopes of reaching the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia.
Griffiths feels he can cope with such pressure despite admitting to nerves as he looks to score his first international goal.
""Maybe I am trying too hard and I just need to relax a little bit more,"" he said ahead of Sunday evening's game at Hampden.
""I want to try and break my duck for Scotland as quickly as possible.
""It's frustrating for a striker, not scoring, but it's not about me - it's about the team and how I can help them to get the three points.""
Strachan's future is on the line should his strategy fail, but Griffiths insists the squad is fully behind the former Celtic manager.
""There's a lot of things said about the gaffer that is probably unfair,"" said the striker. ""We as players need to take on that criticism as well.
""Everybody loves coming away with Scotland and playing for the gaffer.

"The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail.
Juno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July.
The flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere.
The 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious.
""First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,"" the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement.
""There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter.
""We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.""
Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team.
He told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: ""The team's reaction was amazement. 'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping.""
When the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off.
It had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world.
The probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora.
Earth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images.
And Juno's Radio/Plasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field.
Juno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet.
The spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties.
We should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre.
We will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go.
And Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places.
""We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe.
""We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter.""
The spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days.
This configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiterâ€™s atmosphere.
By that stage, however, scientists hope to have built a formidable data-set to help answer their most pressing questions about this vast world.

"Rajab, who heads the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), was convicted in 2012 of taking part in illegal gatherings and disturbing public order.
An appeals court later reduced his original three-year term by a year.
He was one of several leading activists arrested by the authorities after pro-democracy protests erupted in 2011.
Soon after his release on Saturday, Rajab told the Associated Press news agency that he was happy to be out after spending more than 600 days in prison.
He also appealed for the release of all political prisoners, the agency added.
Rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights First, have campaigned on behalf of Rajab throughout his prison sentence, calling on the authorities to release him.
In December 2013, a Bahraini court rejected a request by Rajab's lawyers for early release. They argued that he was eligible because he had already served three-quarters of a two-year sentence.
In addition to his role with the BCHR, Mr Rajab is deputy secretary general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).
Before his imprisonment in July 2012, Mr Rajab was repeatedly detained in connection with the pro-democracy protests that erupted in the Gulf kingdom the previous year.
Amnesty said that he was punched in the face several times by riot police as he led a demonstration in February 2012, and in May 2012 was charged with ""insulting a national institution"" in comments about the interior ministry he posted on Twitter.
In June 2012, Rajab was sentenced to three months in jail over different tweets he wrote about the prime minister. The conviction was eventually overturned on appeal, but only after he had begun his two-year sentence for taking part in unauthorised protests.
At his trial, Mr Rajab told the court that he had been held in dire conditions and subjected to ill treatment, including being placed in solitary confinement with a dead animal and kept almost naked.

"Healthwatch England put in a Freedom of Information request and found psychiatric patients now spend six fewer days in hospital than in 2012-13.
The data, from 32 mental health trusts, shows average number of ""bed days"" per patient per year has fallen by 10%.
Healthwatch England says some patients are being discharged too early and without enough support.
Anna Bradley, chairwoman of Healthwatch England, said the findings reflect a troubling picture where patients discharged from hospital often struggle to access crisis treatment at home.
""What is particularly problematic is when people leave institutions, they cannot access the support they need in the community. We have heard of cases where people have taken their own lives. Our concern is that people are being lost between hospitals and community services.""
Latest statistics show that in recent years, the number of suicides of patients being cared for at home has been double that of inpatients.
Prof Louis Appleby, chairman of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy advisory group, says the numbers represent a change in the nature of acute psychiatric care, with treatment increasingly being provided outside hospitals. While many patients prefer care at home, it can also represent a risk.
""The ideological drive towards services in the community and away from beds, can go too far. Eventually that drive crosses a line - and that line is safety. If you combine the ideological drive with pressure on resources, you have a toxic combination,"" he said.
Graeme Price died after jumping from a multistorey car park in July 2013.
He became ill shortly after taking on a new job and was diagnosed with depression and psychosis.
He was admitted to an assessment ward at Bedford Hospital but discharged after three weeks back to the care of the crisis resolution and home treatment team.
His wife, Linda, said: ""They hadn't done a formal care plan to decide what his treatment should be going forward. They just released him.""
Ten days after being discharged, while on a shopping trip with Linda and his daughter Emily, he jumped to his death.
The coroner said he ""required treatment as an inpatient but no bed was available"".
South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which was responsible for Graeme's care said: ""The circumstances surrounding Mr Price's care were thoroughly investigated, robust action was taken to address the issues identified and the learning was shared with clinical teams.""
According to the most recent report from the Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, investment in the key community teams set up to replace inpatient care has fallen.
Between 2010-11 and 2011-12, investment across the three priority areas - crisis resolution, early intervention and assertive outreach - fell for the first time, by £29.3m from £520m.
Her annual report notes this is ""significant"" given ""the co-existing reduction in bed availability"".
Chris Naylor, of health think tank the King's Fund, said there is evidence that mental health is underfunded compared with physical healthcare, despite recent government promises to ensure parity of esteem.
""Mental health accounts for about 23% of the burden of disease in England, but it only receives around 11% of the funding.

"The PM revived a line used during her Tory leadership campaign to respond to claims the two clashed over dinner.
She also declined to commit to settling the issue of expats' rights by June.
EU sources claim UK misunderstanding of the talks process, and ignorance about how Brussels works, could lead to no deal being agreed on the UK's exit.
According to German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine, the prime minister and Mr Juncker  clashed last Wednesday at Downing Street over Mrs May's desire to make Brexit ""a success"" and whether the issue of protecting the rights of expat UK and EU nationals could be agreed as early as June.
Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mrs May said there were a lot of similarities and common ground in the two sides' positions.
She added: ""But look, I think what we've seen recently is that at times these negotiations are going to be tough.
""During the Conservative Party leadership campaign I was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman. And I said at the time the next person to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker.""
The ""bloody difficult"" quote came from former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke, who was recorded discussing her after a TV interview last year.
Asked about the German newspaper report, Mrs May said: ""I don't recall the account that has been given of the meeting that took place, I think that a lot of this is Brussels gossip.""
But she said that the talks would be tough and would involve either her or Jeremy Corbyn lining up for the UK against the other 27 EU leaders.
Theresa May's comment is revealing about her strength, and also her weakness. No political leader wants to be seen to be pushed around. When the UK talked tough as a member of the EU the others had no choice but to listen.
But now the UK is on the way out, the incentives for the others to pay attention - let alone do our bidding - is very different.
Refusing to be pushed around is one thing, refusing to show any sign of compromise or listen quite another.

Pressed on whether she did believe the issue of the rights of EU nationals in the UK - and Britons abroad - could be settled in June, she said: ""I've always said that I want this to be an issue that we address at an early stage.""
""I've always said that there are complexities to this issue and lots of details that will need to be agreed. What people want to know is to have some reassurance about their future. I believe we can give that at an early stage. I've got the will to do this,"" she added.
She also said she would have ""no intention of doing anything other"" than serving a full term until 2022 if she wins the 8 June general election.
Opposition parties have accused the Tories of pursuing a ""hard Brexit"" strategy, with the PM insisting no deal is better than a bad one and planning to withdraw the UK from the EU single market.

"The memory of the ""Boy from Bassendean"" - a suburb in the Western Australian state capital - is being erased by the local council.
He has gone from favourite son to outcast by a simple show of hands at a council meeting.
Harris's artworks will be taken down from its chambers and his status as a freeman has been rescinded, while a plaque outside his childhood home was stolen before the local authority could remove it.
""We simply cannot tolerate the horrendous crimes for which he's been convicted,"" Bassendean Mayor John Gangell told ABC radio.
And the backlash is spreading.
In Melbourne a public mural, the ""Entertainers of the Century"" that features 100 prominent performers, will be changed to paint over Rolf Harris's cheery image.
There is speculation, too, that Harris could be stripped of his Order of Australia award, one of the nation's most coveted honours.
His conviction comes at a sensitive time for Australia, where the depravity of paedophiles is being scrutinised like never before.
A royal commission into institutional responses to child sex abuse continues to uncover a terrible flood of atrocities, and could take years to complete its task.
Justice Peter McClellan, who chairs it, believes that victims who have suffered alone for so long are finally coming forward because of high-profile court cases, including the conviction of Harris.
""It is becoming apparent as we do our work that as the issue of abuse is raised and talked about, survivors increasingly feel able to bring their own story to the authorities,"" said Justice McClellan.
""That which may have been kept secret for years may now be told. The burden of guilt and shame which many have felt is lifted by knowing that others who have suffered have overcome their reticence,"" he added.
The law firm Slater & Gordon says since Harris's trial began it has been contacted by around a dozen women in Australia and New Zealand alleging they were molested by the TV presenter.

""Given what we heard in [Southwark Crown] court, a number of victims have suffered a very profound damage, I would have thought it highly likely that claims would be brought.""

""Rolf Harris - icon to inmate. Victims vindicated. Hopefully when he comes out there will be more victims waiting to send him right back,"" Ms Johnston tweeted.

"The prime minister told MPs the plan must be treated seriously, but also ""tested out properly"" to ensure it was not a ""delaying tactic"" or a ""ruse"".
He said the resolution would include ""a proper timetable, process and consequences if it's not done"".
The plan is for stockpiles to go under international control and be destroyed.
Mr Cameron said the Russian plan, apparently welcomed by Syria, was an idea ""definitely worth exploring"" but added that he entered the process with a ""hard head and cool calculations"".
Mr Cameron, who spoke to US President Obama and France's President Hollande on Tuesday, said he wanted to ensure that this was not just a way ""to simply buy time"" for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Mr Cameron told the liaison committee of senior MPs that if one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles could be eliminated it would be a ""significant step forward"".
But he said the UK and its allies must remain sceptical.
The wording of a joint US, French and UK resolution on Syria's chemical weapons is unlikely to be agreed on Tuesday, Whitehall sources have told the BBC.
By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor
I am told that the wording is still very much a work in progress
Diplomats from the three allies are said to be discussing the questions of ""what, where, when, who and how"" - in other words what weapons should be removed from Syria, where should they be taken to, according to what timetable and who should supervise it, BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said.
There was also a discussion about what type of UN resolution should be tabled - whether it should be a so-called chapter 7 or chapter 6 resolution, he added.
Chapter 7 resolutions are binding, seen as authorising military action if other measures do not succeed. Chapter 6 resolutions, in contrast, are entitled ""Pacific Settlement of Disputes"" and stipulate that parties to a dispute should use peaceful methods of resolving disputes, such as negotiation and mediation.
Russia's ambassador to France, Alexandre Orlov, earlier said Moscow was ready to negotiate a UN resolution that foresees international control of Syria's chemical weapons, but ruled out a recourse to use force to impose it.
President Obama said he would put plans for a US military strike on hold if Syria agreed to place its stockpiles under international control.
He described the idea - in response to the Syrian government's suspected use of chemical weapons on civilians - as a ""potential breakthrough"", but said he was sceptical the Syrian government would follow through.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said his Syrian counterpart, Walid Muallem, welcomed his country's proposal.
The US accuses Damascus of war crimes including the use of chemical weapons, allegations denied by the regime.
The crisis, which began when anti-government protests were brutally suppressed, has left about 100,000 dead and forced more than two million Syrians to flee the country.
The suspected chemical weapons attack in Damascus on 21 August killed more than 1,400, according to US authorities, entrenching divisions among world leaders on how to respond.
The US has said that the use of chemical weapons crosses a ""global red line"", and President Obama is seeking approval from Congress for military action in response to the attack.
He gave a series of television interviews on Monday aimed at building support in Congress, as he maintained a limited strike was needed to punish President Assad's regime.
Key Syria ally Russia has been highly critical of plans to intervene, arguing that there is no proof the Syrian government was behind the attack, and warning of ""catastrophic consequences"" of military intervention.
While Mr Cameron conceded there was ""never going to be unanimity"" on Syria at last week's summit in St Petersburg, those who supported a strong response following chemical weapons attacks on civilians by the Assad regime made an ""extremely powerful"" case, he said.
""I am clear that it was right to advocate a strong response to the indiscriminate gassing of men, women and children in Syria and to make that case here in the chamber,"" the PM said.
He said he understood and respected the House of Commons' recent decision to vote against intervention, so the UK would not be part of any military action but would continue to press for the strongest possible response, including at the UN.
But shadow chancellor Ed Balls told Channel 4 news that ""jaws dropped"" when Mr Cameron ruled out UK military action in Syria.
Mr Balls insisted Labour would be prepared to revisit the issue if Mr Cameron were able to present new evidence to MPs.
""But he is the prime minister - he has got to lead,"" the shadow chancellor said.
Meanwhile, Business Secretary Vince Cable was accused of allowing the export to Syria of chemicals which could be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons, in breach of the government's own policy.
Sir John Stanley, the chairman of the Commons Committee on Arms Export Controls, said the export licences, issued in January 2012, should never have been approved.
He called on Mr Cable to release the name of the company involved, declaring that he could no longer hide behind the need for commercial confidentiality.
In correspondence with the committee, Mr Cable had said the licences for the export of sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride were granted after an assessment in relation to both EU and UK rules - including whether there was a ""clear risk that they might be used for internal repression"" - and concluded there were no grounds for refusal.",David Cameron has said the UK is to table a UN resolution with France and the US about the Russian plan for Syria to hand over its chemical weapons.,24026065

"Thousands of patients, or their families, will be able to apply to the £380m pot from next month.
Those diagnosed after July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible.
Ministers said the move ended ""years of injustice"".
Mesothelioma can take decades to develop, but when symptoms emerge it progresses rapidly.
Most die within three years of being diagnosed.
Around 2,000 people are diagnosed each year, and the numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.
The cancer is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation.
Until now, victims and their families have been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000.
The new fund will entitle UK claimants to 80% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, meaning payments will range from £115,000 to £123,000.
On top of the payment, the fund will pay out £7,000 towards legal costs.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in January and allowed the creation of the compensation pot, funded by the insurance industry.
Those diagnosed before the scheme was first announced, on 25 July 2012, will not be eligible.
Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer.
Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning said: ""This will end years of injustice for mesothelioma victims and their families - who have had to endure this terrible disease with little hope of any compensation from the insurance industry.
""We have made it an absolute priority to bring in the scheme as soon as legislation will allow, so I am pleased to announce that victims will be able to apply for payments from next month.""
According to government calculations, around 3,500 patients or their dependants are likely to be eligible for support.
Dr John Moore-Gillon, honorary medical adviser at the British Lung Foundation, said: ""Mesothelioma is a particularly devastating disease, killing over 2,400 people every year in the UK, most of whom were innocently exposed to asbestos in the work place.
""The government's announcement today is therefore a positive move for mesothelioma patients and their families, many of whom struggled to gain any compensation at all until recently.
""What we urgently need to see now is greater commitment to funding research into new treatments for mesothelioma.""
He added: ""Although compensation awards are very helpful, they don't change the fact that most people who develop mesothelioma will be dead in less than three years.
""Only research investment will change that - it is what patients and their families want, and with over 50,000 likely to die of the disease in the UK within the next 30 years, it is something we desperately need to prioritise.""","Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, are to receive an average of £123,000 compensation from a new fund.",26465367
"The organisation said that councils stood ""ready, willing and able to take at least 2,000 refugees"".
All 32 local authorities have agreed to support a ""coordinated response"" to the humanitarian crisis.
But not all council areas may end up receiving refugees due to the complex needs of those arriving.
At least 18 local authorities could see the first groups of people arriving before Christmas, Cosla said.
The UNHCR estimates that 520,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, most braving dangerous journeys from North Africa and Turkey as they flee the conflict in Syria.
The Scottish government has pledged to accept at least 2,000 of the 20,000 refugees which the UK government has agreed to take.
Cosla president David O'Neill said there had been an ""unprecedented response"" from Scottish local government to the crisis.
He added: ""A number of councils had already been in discussions with the Home Office about their involvement in the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme.
""The last three weeks has seen all Scotland's councils willing to support a coordinated response to what can only be described as a humanitarian crisis.
""For many councils that has seen them committing to taking refugees immediately.""
Glasgow City Council was one of a small number of councils across the UK that had already taken in Syrian refugees, with more than a quarter of refugees that have arrived in the UK through the scheme being housed there.
Cosla said Scotland's local authorities had an excellent track record in supporting the most vulnerable in society and already had effective systems and partnerships in place which makes them well placed to host Syrian refugees in their communities.
But it said it recognised the scale of the task and the need for detailed planning.
Cosla spokesman Harry McGuigan said: ""We fully recognise that this is not simply about matching people to houses, and that we must meet the wider needs of people so that they can integrate into our communities and build a safe life in Scotland.
""The response to this crisis will therefore be focused on balancing the urgency of the situation with planning the most appropriate ways in which councils and their community planning partners receive and integrate these extremely vulnerable people.""
Cosla called on the Home Office and the Scottish government to ensure the programme is fully resourced so that local authorities and partners in areas such as health, the police and the voluntary sector could put appropriate services in place to meet the needs of refugees.","Syrian refugees are likely to have arrived in many areas of Scotland by Christmas, local authority body Cosla has said.",34418496

"An international team of maritime archaeologists are diving, excavating and recording the wreck of Dutch ship the Rooswijk off the Kent coast.
All 300 shipmen died when the vessel, carrying coins and silver ingots, sank on Goodwin Sands in January 1740.
Never before have any of the Dutch East India Company's 250 wrecks been scientifically excavated on this scale.
Historic England manages the protected site and is working with the Dutch government, which owns the ship's remains.
It is only now, after more than 250 years, that the sands have shifted enough to unveil the wreckage.
Some explorations were carried out last year and those finds are being showcased as part of the #Rooswijk1740 project, led and financed by the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with open days in Ramsgate between 19 August and 16 September.
They include a large seaman's chest, pewter jugs, ornately carved wooden knife handles and leather shoes.
The current mission will see archaeologists delve further into the storage rooms and living quarters in the stern of the ship.
Martijn Manders, project leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage programme manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, said: ""The Goodwin Sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists.
""The rapidly shifting sands mean that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent.""
The wreck is high on the Heritage at Risk register due to its exposed remains and vulnerability to the shifting sands.
Alison James, maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said: ""Wrecks such as the Rooswijk are time capsules that offer a unique glimpse into the past and tell a story.
""We look forward to the fascinating insights and discoveries that the Rooswijk excavation will uncover this summer.""","A ship excavation is expected to reveal a ""treasure trove"" of items and stories from Europe's global trading history.",40962097

"From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories.
The long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round.
BBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games.
With a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world.
West Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup.
The team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup.
West Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1.
""There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,"" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson.
""We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.""
West Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain.
They were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United.
In preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2.
""Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,"" manager Mark Fell said. ""The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation.
""This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.""
When the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them.
Jack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago.
""Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,"" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. ""He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.""
Chris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.
With a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it.
Formed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards.
They shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books.
Claudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup.
He left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning. The prospect of an FA Cup appearance may prove a tempting proposition.
""The FA Cup is the oldest competition in football, and it was always our goal to play in it,"" says Vintila. ""We usually get around 80 to 100 people at games, but hopefully 500 will come down for this game.""
FC Romania, making their FA Cup debut, play Haverhill Rovers in the extra preliminary round this weekend.
As a child, James Phillips used to dream of guiding a non-league side to FA Cup glory as he played Championship Manager on his computer. On Saturday, the 22-year-old Romsey Town boss will not only get to live out his dream, but he'll also be making history as the youngest manager in the competition's history.
""I was one of those sad people after school who was sat there for hours playing Championship Manager,"" Phillips told BBC Sport. ""I always used to try to take a really small club up through the leagues. From a really young age that got my interest going. Now I'm doing it in real life.""
Perhaps winning the award for the most unusual name, and statistic, is Billingham Synthonia - the only team in England named after an agricultural fertiliser.
The Synners most famous player is Brian Clough. The former Derby County and Nottingham Forest manager made four appearances for them, scoring three goals in the 1952-53 season before he went on national service.
On Saturday, the team named after fertiliser host Durham City. It could make for an interesting tie if they progress and are drawn against West Allotment Celtic in the preliminary round...
Never mind dreaming of a Wembley final appearance, the players at one club have their eye on another prize for doing well in the FA Cup - £15 kit bags.
Sporting Khalsa host Pegasus Juniors and, if they win to progress to the preliminary round, a bag sporting the club's emblem is all theirs.
""That's the joys of the FA Cup at grassroots level,"" Sporting Khalsa manager Ian Rowe told the FA.
""The pros are fortunate enough to get to the quarter finals, semi-final and final - we are just looking to win one game so I can splash the cash and buy the lads a £15 bag each.""
Ellesmere Rangers have been involved in the FA Cup every year since 2008-09, but they got into this season's edition by the skin of their teeth.
The Shropshire-based team compete in the West Midlands League Premier Division - the 10th level of English football -  and qualified under the FA's points per game system, which rewards those clubs who miss out on automatic qualification with a place in the competition based on their form across the previous season.
Ellesmere qualified in the final slot, effectively making them entry number 736 - the last team in the hat.
""We finished 11th last season so we didn't expect to get in this year,"" says club secretary John Edge. ""It really is a big boost for the club because the prize money can help you through a whole season.""
On 30 May, 2015, the FA Cup trophy will stand on a pedestal at a packed Wembley, but its journey begins in more humble surroundings.
The trophy will travel to Gloucestershire on Saturday, to the town of Fairford, whose team begin their FA Cup journey with a home tie against Knaphill.
""It is a huge day for the club,"" said committee member Chris Tanner. ""Everyone at Fairford is looking forward to the game and to have the FA Cup coming to town is quite special.
""The FA Cup generates tremendous interest for clubs both in the professional game and non-league and Saturday will be no different.
""Perhaps some won't have realised the FA Cup starts in August.""
The Football Association has quite a job on its hands to make sure all extra preliminary round results are accurate, and that teams do not field ineligible players.
In previous years, the home club would report results by voicemail message, which would then have to be decoded by the FA and Press Association before the result could be confirmed and later published. These days the system is set up to be more efficient.
The FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message.
In order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place.

"Sylvia Blackburn, 72, suffered serious head injuries outside Bedford Road Lower School, Kempston, on 19 December 2014.
Luton Crown Court heard Brian Wright, 55, of Kempston, said he was unable to see at the point of impact.
He denies causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
Prosecutor Sally Mealing-McLeod said Mrs Blackburn, a lollipop lady for 20 years, had been on duty in Bedford Road as pupils were leaving school on the last day of term.
She was wearing a long-sleeved high-visibility orange and yellow coat which had reflective strips and ""school crossing patrol"" written on the back.
When the traffic lights turned red, she stepped out to escort a woman and her six-year-old daughter across the road.
Traffic travelling in the opposite direction stopped, but Mr Wright's VW Golf failed to stop and hit her at 14mph, the jury heard.
Witnesses described Mrs Blackburn's head hitting the screen pillar of the windscreen before she struck the wing mirror and then the road.
The married mother of three was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
She was later transferred to Bedford Hospital and is now at a residential care home for people with an acquired brain injury.
Mr Wright, of The Dell, declined to comment in police interview but in a statement said he was blinded by the setting sun and lowered his visor but was unable to see when the collision happened.

"The measures are outlined in the Digital Economy Bill, which was published on Tuesday.
It says phone operators could be penalised if they miss coverage targets and other licence commitments made to the sector's regulator.
And it sets out how a separate watchdog could punish adult sites that fail to check their visitors' ages.
Other measures include:
If the bill is passed, Ofcom would be able to fine mobile networks a maximum £20,000 a day, up to a total sum of £2m, if they fail to hit agreed service goals.
The regulator has suggested this would give it ""more flexibility in our important work to manage and ensure optimal use of spectrum"".
""At the moment, when a provider breaches its licence, in most cases our only sanction is to remove the licence completely, or launch criminal proceedings,"" a spokesman said.
""The bill would allow Ofcom alternatively to impose financial penalties, which may in some cases be a more proportionate means of securing compliance.""
The law also proposes creating a separate age-verification regulator, which will be told to publish guidelines about how sites should ensure their users are aged 18 or older.
It says this body should be able to fine pornographers up to £250,000 if they fail to comply.
Details of how this would work in practice have still to be determined.
But the bill states that the watchdog would be able to alert credit cards and other payment providers as well as other companies providing a service to the sites in cases where it cannot persuade their owners to comply.
One detail not mentioned in the bill is that the new broadband universal service obligation (USO) should set 10Mbps as the minimum download speed.
However, a factsheet issued by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport does refer to this as being its ""ambition"".
""Ofcom has reported that 10Mbps is the speed needed for a USO, given a typical household's use of digital services, and is adequate for demanding services like streaming high definition video content,"" it says.
""The speed will be specified in regulations to allow it to be updated when necessary.
""Regulations can be updated in a much shorter timescale than a new bill, which can take a year before it can be brought into force.""
Assuming there are no major amendments to the bill, one industry watcher said its impact would probably be determined by how tough the two regulators were willing to be.
""No matter how the law gets written, it's how the regulators implement it and who they chase for non-compliance that determines its real-world effect,"" said Andrew Ferguson, from the Thinkbroadband news site.

"She was discovered by soldiers investigating suspected members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

Two weeks ago, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari said the army had driven Boko Haram's militants from the last camp in their Sambisa forest stronghold in north-eastern Nigeria.
""The terrorists are on the run and no longer have a place to hide,"" Mr Buhari said in a statement.
Boko Haram has killed 15,000 people and displaced over two million during its seven-year battle to create an Islamic caliphate in the north-east of the country.","The Nigerian army says that one of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls has been found, along with her six-month-old baby.",38524331

"Andre Andre gave Porto the lead, volleying in after Asmir Begovic pushed away Yacine Brahimi's effort.
Midfielder Willian equalised on the stroke of half-time with a superb free-kick from the edge of the area.
Maicon put the home side ahead again with a flicked header at the front post, before Diego Costa rattled the bar with a curling shot.
Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas and Pedro both forced Spain team-mate Iker Casillas - making a record 152nd appearance in the competition - into saves early on.
But despite their early pressure, and a late penalty claim for a handball by Ivan Marcano, they came away from the Estadio do Dragao with nothing.
Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho surprisingly left out last year's PFA player of the year Eden Hazard, who has struggled for form this season.
On-loan striker Radamel Falcao failed to even make the bench against his and Mourinho's former team.
Meanwhile, Brazil midfield duo Willian and Ramires - who both came on and scored in the 2-2 draw against Newcastle at the weekend - were named in the starting side, as was striker Diego Costa, currently serving a domestic suspension.
But it was in defence that the Blues looked to have the biggest problems when the Portuguese league leaders - who won the competition when Mourinho was in charge in 2004 - went ahead six minutes before half-time.
Full-back Branislav Ivanovic's indifferent season continued when he was too easily beaten by Algerian Brahimi in the lead-up to Andre's goal.
Mourinho described his side's first-half performance against the Magpies as ""minus one out of 10"" and this tie looked to be heading the same away until Willian levelled with a curling free-kick.
Chelsea have conceded the second most goals (14) in the Premier League this season and Jolen Lopetegui's Porto underlined the London club's problems at the back as Maicon lost his marker to reach a near-post corner and head past Begovic. Danilo also hit the post from another set piece.

Toiling in 15th place in the defence of their Premier League title, eight points behind leaders Manchester United, Mourinho's side have now suffered five defeats in 11 games in all competitions this season.
The Portuguese manager has had disagreements with the media and differences with his coaching staff as his team have stuttered so far domestically - and Mourinho's troubles appeared to have spilled over into Europe.
Mourinho's side easily defeated Maccabi Tel Aviv 4-0 in their opening group game and Chelsea might have taken a point from a hardworking Porto side.
But they saw efforts either hit the woodwork or deflected wide, while Marcano appeared to handle the ball in the area.
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho: ""We watch dozens and dozens of repetitions of Porto taking corners. We were completely ready for that and in a moment when the game is under control we concede a goal that is ridiculous.
""They hit the post from a similar mistake. Apart from that, the game was balanced. Two ridiculous moments and we were punished.""
Porto coach Julen Lopetegui: ""The players attitude was amazing, spectacular. It was our best performance of the season. I have to congratulate my team. This three points are totally deserved. It was tough and unfair to go to the dressing room at half-time with a draw, but we reacted well.""

"The Republican nominee denied ever sexually assaulting women, but turned his fire on ex-President Bill Clinton in a bitter US presidential debate.
""There's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women,"" he said.
Hillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband.
Mr Trump's attack on the Clintons came after moderator Anderson Cooper asked him about a 2005 video released on Friday that revealed Mr Trump bragging about groping women.
The 70-year-old billionaire dismissed the remarks as ""just words"" and ""locker room talk"".
When pressed on whether he had engaged in sexual misconduct, he denied doing so and instead focused on Mr Clinton's previous indiscretions.
No criminal charges have been brought against Mr Clinton in any allegations of sexual assault.
Mrs Clinton said the explosive video, which has sparked an exodus of Republicans denying support to their presidential nominee, ""represents exactly who he is"".
""With prior Republican nominees, I disagreed with them,"" she added, ""but I never questioned their fitness to serve.
When the two took to the stage in St Louis for their second of three debates, they did not shake hands, striking a bitter tone that would continue throughout.
Mr Trump said if he won, he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton and she would be in prison over her private email arrangements.
""Everything he just said is absolutely false but I'm not surprised,"" she responded. ""It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.""
""Because you'd be in jail,"" he interrupted.
Mr Trump also said his Democratic rival ""has tremendous hate in her heart"" while criticising her for referring to his supporters as ""deplorables"".
Mrs Clinton said she apologised for the comment, adding: ""My argument is not with his supporters, it's with him, about the hateful and divisive campaign he has run.""
The two also sparred on the conflict in Syria, Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plan for the ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants arriving from countries with links to terrorism.
The evening concluded when an audience member asked the candidates to say one positive thing about each other.
Mrs Clinton said his children were a great reflection of him while Mr Trump called his opponent ""a fighter"" who never gives up.
An hour before the debate began, Mr Trump appeared at a news conference with women who accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct.
He joined three women who allege the former president sexually assaulted them and called the women ""very courageous"".
The Republican was under immense pressure after making obscene comments about women in the video.
At least 33 senior Republicans - including senators, members of Congress, and state governors - have withdrawn their support since the video surfaced on Friday.
Donald Trump entered this debate threatening to unload every bit of malicious allegations and rumours on Hillary Clinton. And he did.
Accusations of Bill Clinton's sexual impropriety? Check. Her work as a public defender representing a rapist? Yup. He even tied it up in a bow by remarking that his Democratic opponent should be in jail.
Mrs Clinton said she would take the high road, but she did get in her shots as well, saying the illicit video of Mr Trump's lewd comments showed who he really is.
And then, after that nuclear exchange, the debate chugged along - with Mr Trump often gaining the upper hand. If his weakness is policy knowledge, there were few opportunities where his shortcoming were exposed.
Instead, there was plenty of time for Mrs Clinton to offer a yet another muddled answer on her email server and essentially confirm that the Wikileaks hacked speech excerpts are accurate. Mr Trump offered word salads in answers about healthcare reform and Syria policy. If anything, from there the debate was a draw.
With Mrs Clinton ahead right now, a draw will probably suit her just fine. But it wasn't the knock-out blow her supporters probably hoped for.
Who won the debate?
Mrs Clinton also defended controversial remarks she made in a private speech that was made public in leaked emails on Saturday.
The transcript had revealed she said a politician has a public and private position, but at the debate she said she had watched a film about Abraham Lincoln and was referring only to what he had done.
Clinton's Wall Street speeches leaked
Mr Trump appeared with Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who settled a sexual harassment suit against Mr Clinton for $850,000 in 1999 with no admission of guilt.
Juanita Broaddrick, who claimed Mr Clinton raped her in a hotel room in 1978, also appeared with Mr Trump.
Mr Clinton has denied the claim through his lawyer and no charges have ever been brought against him.
The third woman was Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide who said Mr Clinton groped her in his office in 1993, but had previously said it never happened.
Mr Clinton has also denied this claim.
Katty Kay:
Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who spoke, encountered Mrs Clinton in a criminal case when she was 12 years old.
Early in Mrs Clinton's legal career, she was appointed to defend Ms Shelton's rapist, despite objections, and had his sentence reduced to a lesser charge.
Years later, an audio tape emerged of Mrs Clinton speaking with a reporter, in which she can be heard laughing about the case.
During one instance, she laughed after explaining that her client had passed a lie detector test, which convinced her to never trust them again.

"South Wimbledon and Queensway stations will be the first to see their staff moved from ticket offices into ticket halls and on to platforms.
Transport for London (TfL) said it would save £50m annually as it tries to save £4.2bn by 2020.
But Manuel Cortes, from the TSSA union, said London Mayor Boris Johnson was ""rushing through"" the closures.
Mr Cortes, leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association said: ""Talks on the safety implications of closing over 250 stations have not even been concluded.
""The mayor doesn't seem concerned about how millions of tourists will cope with fewer staff to help them on their way.""
TfL said all stations would remain staffed and 150 new ticket machines would be installed by April 2016.
It added that new visitor centres would be created at larger stations such as Victoria and King's Cross to help visitors.
Nick Brown, London Underground's chief operating officer, said more staff were being placed ""where they can offer the best possible assistance"" as only 3% of Tube tickets were bought at ticket offices.
He said: ""This forms part of our wider vision for the Tube, which includes a 24-hour weekend service on core parts of the network.""
But the changes have led to previous strikes by the Aslef and RMT unions.
Labour's London Assembly transport spokeswoman Val Shawcross said: ""When he was elected, Boris Johnson promised Londoners he would protect the capital's ticket offices, but today he starts the process of dismantling each and every one of them.
""Whilst there is obviously a big role for ticket machines to play, there is no substitute for a member of staff.""
London Underground said after 100 meetings with unions the number of roles to be reduced had fallen from 950 to 897 with no member of staff facing compulsory redundancy or losing money.",Ticket offices will start closing on the London Underground later in a move that has prompted past strikes.,31084967

First-half tries from Jonny May and Courtney Lawes were matched by a near-identical pair by George Ford and Owen Farrell in the second period to overwhelm the visitors.
England had failed to beat the Springboks in their previous 12 meetings over 10 years, but after a Grand Slam in spring and whitewash of Australia in summer, the autumn has begun with more history being made.
Inspired by a note-perfect display from scrum-half Ben Youngs, this performance was further undeniable evidence of the vast improvement made under the wily Jones.
Watch: England v South Africa highlights iPlayer
Read: 'With every game a little more promise shows for England'
Listen: England can get a lot better - Jones
Just over a year ago, England were knocked out of the World Cup they were hosting at the group stage, a mile away from competing with the best in the world.
Now only New Zealand are ranked ahead of them, that status entirely deserved despite the obvious room for further improvement.
After an early penalty and drop-goal from South Africa's Pat Lambie, England showed their ambition, Ford using Elliot Daly as a decoy runner in midfield off quick line-out ball to put Marland Yarde and Mike Brown in space, May finishing in the corner with trademark speed on his return to the side.
But the Springboks' power was hurting England, with six penalties conceded in the first 20-odd minutes and clean line-breaks made by both props. Lambie's second three-pointer regained the lead for the visitors at 9-7.
Gradually, England found the balance between pragmatism and adventure. Youngs' kicking and sniping helped regain the initiative, Farrell landed a penalty and then the men in white struck again.
With the ball going through hands again Daly kicked long from inside his own half, May forced JP Pietersen into a fumble, Brown kicked on and second row Lawes dived on the loose ball as it rolled over the try-line.
Farrell added the conversion and then Daly marked the occasion of his first England start with a monstrous penalty from halfway for a lead of 20-9 at the interval.
Now it was England with the power, Billy Vunipola sucking in tacklers with his carrying, the Springboks' defence stretched and then fatally weakened.
Youngs spotted space around the fringes on the opposition 22, beat blind-side flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit with an outrageous dummy and found Ford on his right shoulder to put his fly-half away for their side's third try.
South Africa came into the match having lost four of their past five games, and shipped a half-century of points at home to the All Blacks in their last outing.
A breakaway try from replacement Johan Goosen briefly gave them hope, but when Youngs foxed Du Toit with a replica dummy to send Farrell away, England's authority was once again absolute.
Willie le Roux crossed late in the left-hand corner to underline England's need to tighten their defence.
But in difficult conditions, this was an accomplished display, and with Fiji in London next weekend, Jones will expect that flawless record to be extended further still.
A perfect scrum-half's performance in conditions like this - precision box-kicking, snappy passes to his big ball-carriers, picking the ideal moments to snipe and break.
England captain Dylan Hartley: ""There's plenty to work on, so that keeps us grounded. We conceded six penalties in the opening 20 minutes and that isn't good enough. But we're very happy to get that monkey off our back and I'm very proud of our guys.""
South Africa captain Adriaan Strauss: ""It was a very tough game, they were tactically very good and we couldn't deal with the high ball. We just couldn't put any pressure on the England team and we felt it the whole game. We'll have a hard look at ourselves on Monday and we'll fight back.""

"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways.
Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography.
The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories.
Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man"".
Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure"", they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made"".
He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour"".
Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community.
Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images.
Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for.
On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating.
During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years"".
Defence lawyer Taylor Campbell said that Lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.","A man, who downloaded thousands of images of children being sexually abused, has been released on probation.",36207710
"The watchdog's annual report on education standards says about a third of secondary schools in the North and Midlands are not good enough.
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw says more attention must be focused on regions where too many schools are ""languishing in mediocrity"".
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said more needed to be done to ""tackle pockets of underperformance"".
The chief inspector of schools warns of schools in some cities in the North and Midlands that have ""failed miserably year after year after year"".
Ofsted annual report 2015
Sir Michael named 16 weak local authorities - where less than 60% of children attend good or outstanding schools and have below average ""attainment and progress"" at GCSE - with 13 in the North and Midlands.
They are Barnsley, Blackpool, Bradford, Derbyshire, Doncaster, Hartlepool, Knowsley, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Oldham, Salford, St Helens and Stoke on Trent.
The other three are the Isle of Wight, Swindon and South Gloucestershire.
In Bradford, Sir Michael said the problems were so serious that he wanted a commission of inquiry and a separate commissioner for education.
And he warned that poor education meant that young people could be alienated and the ""dangers of being alienated from British society are very great indeed"".
Increasing attention is being paid to the geography of school underachievement - such as in coastal areas and regional differences.
And the report highlights concerns about a north-south gap - with stronger GCSE results in London and the South and weaker results in parts of the North and Midlands.
""This gap is a worrying one. We don't want to see a divided country after the age of 11,"" Sir Michael said.
More than 400,000 pupils in the North and Midlands go to a school that is ""less than good"", and the Ofsted chief said this could not be ""explained away"" by higher levels of deprivation.
Primary schools were much more successful than secondary, Sir Michael said, despite facing similar problems of social disadvantage.
He also used the example of London to show how deprivation need not be inevitably linked to lower results.
Sir Michael called for greater ""political will"" and more attention to improve the quality of teaching.
""We've seen a significant difference in the quality of teaching between the South and the Midlands and the North, a significant difference in terms of the quality of leadership... and we need to worry about this as a nation,"" he said.
""The mediocrity in secondary performance should be a national concern - and the mediocrity is residing mainly, but not exclusively, in the Midlands and north of England.
""If the 'northern powerhouse' is going to mean something, then we've got to improve educational performance in our secondary schools north of the Wash.""
Sir Michael also warned that problems were being exacerbated by difficulties in recruiting teachers - and that schools in challenging areas could have the toughest time finding enough teachers in some subjects.
Recruitment problems were having a ""significant impact"", said the Ofsted chief.
Watchsted, a website that gathers inspections data, ranks local authorities in terms of the proportion of schools rated as ""outstanding"" or ""good"".
The bottom 10 at secondary school level includes northern authorities such as Knowsley, Bradford, Oldham, Blackpool and Doncaster - but also the Isle of Wight and Cambridgeshire.
Eight out of the top 10 authorities at secondary level are in London or the South East.
""More and more we are seeing that schools facing the biggest challenges are now in coastal and market towns, rather than large cities. And children from low income families have the greatest barriers,"" said James Westhead, executive director of Teach First.
Most secondary schools in England now have academy status - but the annual report says that in terms of raising standards ""structural reform can only do so much"".
And it highlights that being an academy does not ""insulate"" schools from decline, with 99 academies that had been good or outstanding being regraded as less than good.
Roy Perry, chairman of the children and young people board at the Local Government Association, said ranking councils by school results ""disguises the fact that over 60% of secondary schools are now academies, leaving councils powerless to intervene early and build an improvement programme"".
""It is extremely worrying that over the last three years only 37% of secondary schools have actually improved their Ofsted rating after becoming academies.""
The Ofsted report also highlights that pupils' progress up to the end of primary is too often not sustained when they move to secondary.
This was revealed last month in an analysis of this summer's GCSE results, by education data company, SchoolDash.
This mapped the growing north-south divide at GCSE level, but also showed there was much less of a gap in primary school.
Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman linked the north-south gap to the ""very serious difficulties"" that schools faced in recruiting teachers.
Mr Lightman, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools in challenging areas were finding it ""incredibly hard"" to find teachers in some shortage subjects, particularly affecting schools in some parts of the North.
Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the gap between primary and secondary performance had been ""driven by the turmoil at secondary compared to primary"", such as the upheavals in exams and curriculum.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ""More needs to be done to deliver educational excellence everywhere.""
""That's why we are introducing new measures to transform failing and coasting schools, funding the best academy chains to share excellence in struggling regions in the North and creating a National Teaching Service - sending some of our best teachers to the areas that need them most.""",Ofsted is warning of a north-south divide in England's secondary schools.,34964522

Fewer than a third gave positive responses to questions about leadership and direction.
Queen's recently introduced major changes to some faculties and more than 140 staff left under a voluntary redundancy process in 2015-16.
However, staff were more positive about other aspects of the university, with two-thirds saying they were proud to work there.
Almost nine in 10 who responded said Queen's had a high standing in Northern Ireland, while two-thirds would recommend it as a ""great place to study"".
The vast majority of respondents - 89% - said that they found their work interesting.
While only a quarter of staff agreed that ""Queen's works as one university"", more than three-quarters said it was ""committed to world class research"".
However, fewer than a third of staff believed any action would be taken as a result of the survey.
In a statement, a Queen's spokesperson said the university was committed to ""staff engagement and a positive work environment"".
""The positive results highlight a number of key strengths, including staff respect, interesting work and a sense of personal accomplishment.
""The university is now working in partnership with staff in the development of action plans in response to the results.

Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes.
The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans.
Mr Burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in May, promised to ""radically re-write"" the plans, calling them ""unfair and disproportionate"".
The BBC understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved.
Matthew Collinge from the Save our Slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between Middleton and Royton, said the delay was ""disappointing"".
He said: ""It stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this September deadline.
""We now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours.""
Matthew Good, a spokesman for the House Builder's Federation said: ""It's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this.
""Councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen.
""Without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that.""
A spokesman for Mr Burnham said the mayor had appointed Salford City Mayor Paul Dennett to lead a ""radical"" rewrite of the plans.
He added: ""This re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.""","A plan earmarking sites for 225,000 new homes in Greater Manchester is set to be delayed amid a ""radical rewrite"" to help protect green belt land.",40673109

"Most tax accountants would advise a wealthy family on ""gifts"" - payments of money - to their children and how to ensure they are not liable for inheritance tax by making payments in tranches to avoid breaching tax thresholds.
Mr Cameron's family appear to have done this, and Downing Street says the payments were made by the Prime Minister's mother to ""even out"" the inheritance payments made to her children following her husband's death.
Not to avoid tax.
When Mr Cameron's mother dies, her estate becomes liable to inheritance tax. Under the ""seven-year rule"", if she dies before 2018, the value of that estate will include earlier gifts to her children.
The rule was put in place to stop parents simply transferring assets to their children shortly before they died to avoid tax liabilities.
Some may argue that it is morally wrong and that everyone should order their affairs so they take no advantage of rules which allow people to pay less tax on their wealth.
And, of course, many millions of people are not wealthy enough to ever have to consider such issues.
Whatever critics may desire, the UK's tax law is not governed by a ""morality code"", it is based on statute and is structured so that people, by following the rules, pay no more tax than they are legally obliged to.
In fact, in one part of Mr Cameron's tax affairs, he has actually paid more tax than legally necessary, by waiving the tax-exempt £20,000 allowance that prime ministers receive to cover the expenses of holding the office of PM.
He still faces questions, though.
Downing Street is providing no details about the £72,000 the PM received for selling ""other shares"" beyond his investment in Blairmore Holdings.
Or the £40,000 he received in cash from his stockbroking account.
It is argued by some that Mr Cameron should reveal which shares he invested in and how he structured those investments.
Also, it is worth noting that revealing tax returns reveals very little about a person's absolute wealth - which is a wholly different matter and one which the French economist, Thomas Piketty, would say is the real issue at hand when it comes to debates about wealth inequality.
As he did in an interview with me last week.
What the PM has done today is change the rules on what politicians will be obliged to reveal about their formerly private tax affairs.
It is difficult to see how any member of the Cabinet, and indeed the whole government, can refuse to give details of their own tax affairs going back six years.
To refuse would raise the question - why not?
Members of the Opposition front bench will be under similar pressure - pressure that goes beyond, for example, what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has so far published.
In six short days, the prime minister has travelled from a position of ""this is a private matter"" to a personal tax shock and awe.
For politicians, and possibly many other people, he has changed the long-held principle that tax is a private matter in a way that will reverberate for many years to come.",One person's tax planning is another person's tax avoidance - so whether David Cameron's tax affairs are controversial or not is really a matter of where you stand on the payment of tax.,36009963
"Lauro Bertulano, 46, and Rebecca Jones, 31, neglected patients on a specialist stroke ward at Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.
A third, Natalie Jones, 42, was given a community order for the same offence.
Cardiff Crown Court heard they failed to check blood glucose levels at least every two hours on multiple occasions.
All three previously pleaded guilty to multiple charges of wilful neglect.
Rebecca Jones was sentenced to eight months, Bertulano to four and Natalie Jones was given a 12-month community order.
Sentencing, Judge Tom Crowther QC said: ""I pause to remind myself that you all would have seen worried relatives coming and going, sitting with their mothers, fathers or spouses as they lay ill, some approaching the end of their lives, and to wonder with bemusement how you could have continued to betray your patients and those families as you did.
""This was not a failure to do your job, it was a failure of compassion and humanity.
""This was clear-eyed and calculated deception, the purpose of which was to make the defendants' working time easier.
""There was also... a real risk to health, even if that risk happily did not materialise.""
In a statement read to the court, Gareth Williams, whose mother Lilian's records were falsified by all three defendants, said the family had been left ""completely haunted and traumatised"" by their mother's treatment after their repeated complaints to staff were ignored.
""During those tortuous months each dreadful day was an eternity that seemed to merge into a long nightmare,"" he said.
His sister, Christine Williams, said the experience had completely destroyed her faith in the medical profession, adding: ""I no longer believe we have a health service to be proud of.""
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board offered ""sincere apologies"" to the families involved and said it would be contacting them with an offer to meet and answer questions.
It said in a statement an internal review had established no patients had been harmed by the nurses' actions, but apologised again for ""the distress caused.
""We are also now able to commission further work to consider what can be learned from these events, and to ensure we have everything in place to avoid it happening again,"" the statement read, adding internal proceedings were under way with 12 other nurses suspended from work.
Chief executive Paul Roberts said he was confident that the practices uncovered in the investigation were ""not widespread"".
Rebecca Jones had admitted nine charges relating to nine patients, Bertulano to six charges and Natalie Jones to two, all relating to the period between 2012 and 2013.
The court heard concerns were first raised in February 2013 when there were discrepancies between blood glucose levels recorded in patients' notes and readings on a glucose meter taken by Rebecca Jones.
She was suspended and an investigation of the ward was launched.
It found that in total, she made 51 fake entries in patients' notes, Bertulano made 26, while Natalie Jones made four.
Patients on the ward should have been routinely tested every two hours, but one went 26 hours without being checked.
The court heard the absence of such tests could be potentially harmful to those unable to regulate their own blood glucose levels.
Nicholas Gareth Jones, defending Rebecca Jones, said she was unhappy at work and felt stressed but had no explanation for her actions.
Matthew Roberts, defending Bertulano, said he was under ""considerable"" pressure at work and all his false recordings were made on night shifts when there were only two workers on duty.

"The call handling and IT system is more than Â£40m over budget and was initially due to be ready for October 2013.
An earlier attempt to introduce the system had to be abandoned.
The programme will now be phased in for some services from this summer with a national roll-out by the end of 2017.
Earlier this year, the planned June launch was pushed back to the ""summer of 2016"" after an issue that caused computer screens to appear blank.
It followed an earlier incident in which the system crashed and staff had to resort to pen and paper to deal with patient calls.
The new technology is meant to make NHS 24 more efficient but is expected to cost Â£117m, more than 50% higher than the original estimate.
NHS 24 said the new telephone system would be in place this year for services including Breathing Space, NHS Living Life, the musculoskeletal helpline, death certification, blood transfusion and Fit For Work.
It will then be introduced in one health board area to ensure it is working effectively before the national roll-out.
NHS 24 chief executive Angiolina Foster said: ""We expect to have a functioning technology system tested and available later in the summer.
""However, we have recognised that ensuring our staff and operational environment are also fully ready to accept the technology is absolutely essential to making sure we can make a smooth transition to the new system.""
Ms Foster said: ""We recognise that the past 18 months have been challenging for the organisation and know that the professionalism and dedication of our people has enabled us to give high-quality care to patients during this time.""
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: ""While any delays to implementation are disappointing, patient safety must always come first. This is why NHS 24 has taken the decision to phase the roll-out of its Future Programme.
""This decision follows a comprehensive review of the new system which concluded that a phased roll-out later this summer, working towards full implementation across all health boards by the end of 2017, would be both safe for patients and deliverable by the organisation.""",A crisis-hit computer project for the NHS 24 telephone helpline will not be fully rolled out across Scotland until the end of next year - four years later than originally planned.,36678121
"Southwark Crown Court was told that Mr Clifford exposed himself to the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
She claims Mr Clifford forced her to perform a sex act on him and that she thought he would ""rape or kill"" her.
Mr Clifford denies indecent assault in his London office in the 1980s. The prosecution has finished its case and the trial was adjourned until Monday.
The court heard that Mr Clifford was asked about the allegation in his police interview.
Det Sgt Jason Price, giving evidence, asked whether Mr Clifford remembered coming out of his office, blocking the alleged victim's access to a stairwell and exposing his penis.
Mr Clifford said: ""No comment.""
Det Sgt Price then said in the interview: ""You gyrated around, so one would assume by that it means moving your hips around.""
Mr Clifford replied: ""What? Dancing or something? No comment.""
The alleged victim claimed that he put her hand on his penis and she said ""I don't want to"" but she ""did as she was told"" and only stopped when they were disturbed by a knock on the door.
At the start of the interview, Clifford gave a statement in which he denied the allegation.
His statement said he had never engaged in sexual relations with someone without their consent and ""neither have I ever needed to coerce someone"".
After his statement was read out in the interview, he answered ""no comment"" to the majority of the questions and said of the allegation: ""Everything about it is totally untrue.""

"That left him having to raise some of the less well-known taxes.
There's an honourable mention for the bringing forward of payments of corporation tax, which raises an impressive £4.5bn in 2017-18, but by the end of the parliament it would be raising very small amounts.
So, here are the top four tax increases, ranked according to the amount of money the Treasury reckons they will raise in 2020-21.
Did you know all of these taxes even existed?
Top of the pile is the change to the way dividends on shares are taxed.
The government is doing away with the current system of dividend tax credit in favour of a tax-free allowance. The first £5,000 someone earns in dividends will be tax-free.
After that, any dividend income will be taxed at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers.
And the Treasury reckons that will raise just under £2bn in 2020-21.
Second on the list is the rise in insurance premium tax.
From November, the standard rate of insurance premium tax will rise from 6% to 9.5%.
The standard rate is charged on most forms of insurance you might be considering, except for travel insurance and insurance on electrical appliances, which are charged at a higher rate of 20%. There are also some forms of insurance that are exempted, such as long term insurance products including life insurance and any forms of reinsurance.
The hike in tax rates will raise about £1.5bn a year for the Exchequer.
Vehicle excise duty (VED) is what you used to know as your tax disc before they were abolished.
At the moment there are lots of different bands of charges.
For cars registered after 1 April 2017 it will be £140 a year with a few exceptions.
Zero emission cars don't pay any VED at all.
The amounts charged in the cars' first year are divided into 13 bands depending on how much carbon dioxide they emit, from £0 for zero emission cars to £2,000 for the most polluting vehicles.
On top of that, if you have a car that had a list price of over £40,000 when new, you have to pay an extra £310 supplement on top of your standard VED for the first five years.
This one was widely mentioned during the election campaign.
At the moment, you get the tax back on any contributions you make to a pension scheme up to a limit of £40,000 a year.
From April next year, the amount you can save tax-free will fall if you are earning more than £150,000 a year.
For every £2 that you earn above that amount, you lose £1 of your tax-free pension savings allowance, down to a minimum of £10,000.
Bear in mind that these predictions of tax revenue are pretty uncertain. The OBR gives a verdict on how uncertain they are.
Pensions tax relief is rated as the most uncertain (""very high"" uncertainty) because of the likelihood that high earners will change the way they save in order to avoid paying extra tax.

"However, they denied German media reports body parts of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had been identified.
The cockpit voice recorder suggested he crashed the plane deliberately.
A transcript leaked to German media revealed the frenzied final minutes, with the pilot, locked out of the cockpit, shouting ""open the damn door!""
Recovery teams have so far only reached the mountainside on foot or by helicopter to continue the search for human remains as well as parts of the aircraft, including the flight data recorder which is still missing.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said an access road was being built to the remote site.
Mr Robin said work on the road, which would give all-terrain vehicles access to the area, could be completed by Monday evening.
The German newspaper Bild published a transcript of the final minutes of the flight as caught on the cockpit voice recorder. It has not been independently verified.
It shows the captain, who has been named in media as Patrick Sondenheimer, telling Lubitz he was not able to go to the toilet before take off, to which the co-pilot replies he can go at any time.
The captain says ""you can take over"".
Lubitz, 27, then appears to refuse to let the captain back into the cockpit.
The captain can be heard banging on the door and screaming: ""For God's sake, open the door!""
The captain tries to break the door down with an axe. Passengers are then heard screaming as the captain begs again to be let in.
Investigators think there is the sound of the plane's wing hitting a mountaintop before final screams.
Meanwhile, there have been calls for a full investigation to be completed before any further conclusions are revealed.
The German Airline Pilots Association pointed out that the flight data recorder was still missing and that the reasons that led to the crash could only be determined once all data had been examined.
The European Cockpit Association said the release of voice recorder data was a ""serious breach"" of globally accepted rules. It said many questions remained unanswered.
The suggestion that the co-pilot's action was deliberate led to speculation about his mental health, especially when investigators found anti-depressants at his house along with evidence of treatment by various doctors, including a torn-up sick note for the day he flew the plane.
Reports about problems with his eyesight - possibly a detached retina - first raised in the New York Times, were also reflected in the German papers.
But no full picture has emerged of what initially caused Lubitz to seek medical help and whether reports that he was stressed are linked to a prospect of impaired vision and its potential impact on his ambition of becoming a long-haul pilot for Germany's main carrier Lufthansa.
Lufthansa, which fully owns Germanwings, says his training was once interrupted but only resumed after his suitability was fully re-established.
Lubitz's ex-girlfriend has said he vowed last year: ""One day I'm going to do something that will change the whole system, and everyone will know my name and remember.""
Family members continue to travel to the site of the crash.
Ippei Yamanaka, co-worker of victim Junichi Sato, told AP: ""His wife says she still she cannot believe what has happened, saying that it almost feels like her husband is away on his business trip and that it still feels like he is going to return soon.""

"BBC Wales understands an advisory panel on creative industries recommends rejecting a request from University of Wales Trinity St David for up to £6m.
The panel is concerned a similar hub already exists in Swansea.
Camarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said the comparison was ""completely inappropriate"".
The panel is chaired by Ron Jones, executive chairman of Tinopolis.
It did not take into account whether the scheme - Yr Egin - would provide any educational or linguistic benefits.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates told the assembly in November it was ""disappointing"" that a ""funding gap"" had appeared since the university first announced the plans in 2014.
Mr Skates has yet to decide on the university's application for between £4m and £6m of public funding.
Directors of the project have previously estimated the new centre for creative industries would be worth £11m a year to the local economy.
Planning permission for the development was granted in October and Kier Group has been appointed as the main contractor.
S4C has previously said its plans to relocate remain unaffected, with 55 jobs moving from Cardiff.  It has agreed to pay £3m in upfront rent for a 20 year lease.

"Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU.
His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely.
He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on.
Profile: Boris Johnson
How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister?
Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"".
He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You.
He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU.
As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015.
Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades.
That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.
Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk.
Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver.
Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.
But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.
Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.
He said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and ""after a huge amount of heartache"". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially ""career-ending move"", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet.
But Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the ""Out"" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader.

"They are young and clever, and they want to change the world - one bus at a time.
""We've created the world's first bus that runs on formic acid, which is a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits,"" says Lucas van Cappellen from Team Fast, a spin-off company from Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.
""We're building our own future.""
Around 40 of his fellow students are endeavouring to develop emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. And they're also trying to create careers for themselves.
Formic acid is found in nature, delivered in the stings and bites of ants and other insects - the Latin word for ant is formica.
And this simple carboxylic acid (chemical formula HCOOH) is already used in textiles and leather processing, as a livestock feed preservative, and is also found in some household limescale removers.
But Team Fast has found a way the acid can efficiently carry the ingredients needed for hydrogen fuel cells, used to power electric vehicles.
The fuel, which the team has dubbed hydrozine (not to be confused with hydrazine), is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly, as with conventional fuels.
The difference is that it is much cleaner.
""The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water,"" explains Mr van Cappellen. ""No other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted.""
To prove the concept in the real world, an electric bus is set to hit the road in the Netherlands later this year, where it will shuttle between running on conventional bus routes and appearing at promotional events and industry fairs.
The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind.
""Our tank is around 300 litres, so we will extend the range of the bus by 200km (180 miles). However, we could of course make the tank bigger very easily,"" says Mr van Cappellen.
Current hydrogen fuel cell buses have a range of up to 400km.
But why develop a bus rather than a car?
""If we built a car, we would compete with electric cars, but we believe battery-powered cars are a good solution for a lot of people,"" says Mr van Cappellen.
""But if we prove that we can build a bus that meets the needs of bus companies, with a range of around 400km and quick refuelling, we will have shown the potential of hydrozine in a segment where there is no sustainable competition yet.""
Hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
More Technology of Business
""In a reactor, water and CO2 are bonded using sustainable electricity. This is a direct, sustainable electrochemical process,"" explains Mr van Cappellen.
The hydrozine is then broken down by a catalyst into hydrogen and carbon dioxide inside a piece of kit called a reformer that Team Fast is attempting to patent.
Its newly designed reformer is a tenth of the size of reformers of the past, which is why ""it is now applicable in transport applications for the first time"".
The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor.
""We are continuously looking for new technologies that can extend the range of zero emissions traffic in a simple way,"" says Menno Kleingeld, managing director, VDL Enabling Transport Solutions.
""The decomposition of formic acid into hydrogen gas is one of these new, promising technologies.""
But does it really stand a chance of becoming commercially viable?
""It costs about 35,000 euros (Â£30,000) to convert a conventional petrol filling station to a hydrozine filling station, a process that essentially involves replacing the pipes and coating the tanks,"" says Mr van Cappellen.
As such, it is ""100 times cheaper"" to roll out a fuelling network for hydrozine than for gaseous hydrogen, he maintains.
""Hydrozine is currently cheaper than petrol and more expensive than diesel in the Netherlands, and in future we expect prices to come down so it will be cheaper than both,"" he adds.
Although the bus emits CO2, Team Fast argues that the original CO2 used to create the hydrozine is taken from existing sources, such as air or exhaust fumes, so that no additional CO2 is produced - it's a closed carbon cycle in the jargon.
Some experts believe the technology shows promise.
""Team Fast has a very good project,"" says Professor Richard van de Sanden, head of the Dutch Institute for Fundamental Energy Research.
""It works on a very important issue: the storing of renewable energy in a transportable form and in a form which can actually be used.""
And several companies are supporting the project.
""What we're working on together is a version of renewable energy that can combine renewable energy with CO2 capture,"" says Martijn de Graaff, senior business development manager at TNO Industry.
""If we achieve this it will give us a stable future.""
The students' own commitment is impressive, with 15 of the 40 working full time on the project, and the rest contributing at least 20-25 hours per week.
""We don't get study points for it, but you can only learn so much at university about the practical experience of things,"" Mr van Cappellen says.
""It's our own future we're making.""","A group of students has developed a way of storing energy that could be cheaper to make, more practical and more sustainable than alternative renewable fuels.",40403351

"They read from Attack of the Shidas about children from different Kenyan communities working together to protect their well from an alien invasion.
The event is meant to foster a culture of reading in the country, the organisers told the BBC.
The US currently holds the Guinness World Record set by 233,000 people.
It will take at least a week to work out whether they have been successful as they need to tally the number of pupils from across the country who participated.
Kenyan children's book author Muthoni Muchemi led the event with 1,700 students reading from her book at Hospital Hill Primary School in the capital, Nairobi.
Afterwards, she said she wanted to break the stereotype that Africans do not care for books.
""Growing up I would always hear that if you want to hide something from an African, put it in a book - and it was really upsetting to me,"" she told the BBC.
""I want to help change that perception and the first step is to re-introduce reading not just as important but enjoyable,"" she said.
""I have seen over the years that a lot of families don't have libraries in their homes but have they have big TVs. We need to get parents to understand that reading for pleasure with their children is an important part of brain development.""

"Ibrahim Halawa, the son of the most senior Muslim cleric in the Republic of Ireland, was arrested during a siege on the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo in 2013.
The mass trial of Mr Halawa and 493 others began in March after being postponed five times since his arrest.
Mr Halawa, 19, could face the death penalty if he is convicted.
Mr Halawa was on a family holiday to his parents' homeland when he and three of his sisters were arrested by Egyptian security forces during a crackdown on protests in the country's capital.
He was 17 at the time.
His family said he had taken refuge in the building during violent clashes between supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi and the security forces.
His sisters were allowed to return to Dublin in November 2013.
On Wednesday, a hearing in his case took place, with Irish officials in attendance.
But it could not proceed as 16 defendants were not present in court, according to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs.
Defence lawyers requested that the trial would not proceed during the forthcoming Ramadan period and the judge agreed to adjourn the matter until 2 August, the department added.
Amnesty International Ireland said Mr Halawa should be released immediately with all charges against him dropped.
Colm O'Gorman, the human rights organisation's executive director in Ireland, said the situation was ""utterly unacceptable"".
""No one should have to withstand the continual raising of hope that they might have their day in court, only to have that hope continually dashed,"" he said.

"Marineland, in Niagara Falls, was also charged with failing to provide adequate food and water for 35 bears, the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (OSPCA) said.
Three final charges relate to failing to comply with the prescribed standards of care for a peacock and guinea hens.
Marineland deny the allegations.
The company told the BBC the accusations were made by ""a former animal care worker who was fired for poor performance and inappropriate behaviour"".
It said the peacock - ""one among thousands of birds"" - had a problem with its eye but was otherwise healthy. It also blamed the OSPCA staff for upsetting the guinea hens and said the concerns over the bears' food were due to some small labels being left on pieces of fruit.
The park spokesman added there had never been concerns raised about the bears' access to water.
However, the OSPCA, which has not removed any animals but is continuing to monitor the situation, says further charges are likely to follow.

"The treatment isn't offered on the NHS, but it's understood some staff have occasionally put patients in touch with organisations who provide it.
Experts say attempting so-called ""gay cures"" can be ""dangerous"" and ""damaging"".
Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients.
Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them.
They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice.
The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, ""does not endorse or support conversion therapy"" and will make this clear to staff.
It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it.
Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was ""really important"".
""It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling.
""We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement.""
There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen.
Amber suggested that an ""ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved"" rather than staff being ""prejudiced against LGB people"" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past.
""I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past,"" she said.
Newsbeat has spoken to people who said they had experienced conversion therapy.
Louise from West Yorkshire said she was blackmailed into receiving ""treatment"" for being gay in 2007 by her evangelical church.
She later attended group sessions of around 20 women near Liverpool. ""[Most] were married with children. They were there without the knowledge of their partners or their children.
""If I'd been more impressionable I think I could have been really damaged by the process.""
Brad, from Illinois, lives in the West Midlands. He said he was ""scared"" when he first discovered he was gay and ""wanted to do my very best to change it"".
He attended group therapy sessions but realised the treatment, which he said encouraged him ""to do more stereotypical masculine things"" wasn't going to change his feelings.
""It's really sad I spent three years of my life trying to do something that was impossible.""
There are some who suggest it works and insist people should be able to try it.
Mike Davidson told Newsbeat he ""converted"" with therapy over the course of two years and now provides what he calls ""support"" for people who have ""unwanted same-sex attraction"" in Northern Ireland.
He thinks the service should be allowed but he wasn't able to give an accurate estimate of how widely the treatment was available.
He told Newsbeat that gay conversion isn't a ""huge industry"" and that the people he works with have decided it is something they want to do.
""By the time they [clients] get to us, they know what we're about and know what they would like to achieve.""
Explaining the process, he said: ""For some people they want to go as far as controlling their behaviour... they do not want to act out on those issues and we would support them.""
He also said that he turns people away who appear to have been pressured into taking therapy and admitted that, even when working with someone who wants to change their sexual feelings, a ""result"" is never guaranteed.
The UK Council of Psychotherapy says it intends to expand the agreement to Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland soon.

"Consider the unreliable plumbing, dated wallpaper, and room service meals that can arrive an hour late and stone cold.
But a German tech start-up called Triprebel hopes to overcome one of the most vexing obstacles to a pleasant stay; paying too much for your room.
Because nothing spoils a trip more than leaving your expensive single room to eat breakfast beside another guest who paid far less for their penthouse suite.
That concern is the driving focus for Triprebel's CEO, Carlos Borges, who describes the new website as the ""smartest way to book your hotel.""
He says current travel search engines - think Expedia, Kayak or Orbitz - offer users a snapshot hotel rate at the precise moment they initiate a search. But the market for hotel rooms, he explains, ""is not like a snapshot, it's like a movie.""
In short, room amenities and prices fluctuate, like plot twists.
Triprebel's algorithm constantly checks the rates for each hotel room, from the moment it is booked, until a couple of days before a guest checks in.
""So if the rate goes down,"" Mr Borges says, ""we change it automatically for you and you get the full advantage of that better rate.""
That 'full advantage' means a refund of the difference in price, with the firm taking a commission on the cheaper replacement booking.
Triprebel's numbers show that a third of hotel rooms are available at a lower rate in the month after they are booked.
The tech start-up is one of several that have taken up residence in one of the warehouse buildings that line Hamburg's old port canals. The firm shares its building with Greenpeace and the WWF in this rapidly developing industrial neighbourhood.
A stack of beer sits waiting in a corner for the end of the week. Mr Borges says the company's growth for the most recent quarter, which he pegs at 140%, is a reason to celebrate.
But before that, a half dozen staff must first test an additional 400,000 hotels that will soon be included in the website's algorithm. An employee's dog provides a welcome distraction, beneath a hanging picture of a Land Rover, with the slogan 'Never Stop Exploring.'
""We are travellers ourselves so we really feel good about helping our fellow travellers,"" enthuses Mr Borges, a Brazilian who originally moved to Germany to study for an MBA.
""When we get an email from someone praising the room he has, because he got upgraded, that's something that makes us feel very enthusiastic about what we're doing.""
Staffers hail from diverse professional backgrounds in Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. Currently about half the website's traffic comes from German users, and it may prove challenging to expand internationally into the already saturated online travel search marketplace.
""Competing with other start-ups is matter of how good your execution is and how well you're funded,"" Mr Borges says. ""So there we have a headstart, we've already been funded. We've already executed some of the technologies.""
But some travel experts question not the technology, but the financial model behind the business.
A website user is not charged a premium to guarantee the cheapest room price, but travel writer Alison Rice says the company's long-term profitability could be reliant on cooperation from the hotel industry.
""They like early bookings so they've got the money in the bank, they know they can stay open and pay their staff,"" says Ms Rice of hotel proprietors.
""What happens when, come nearer the date, they decide to drop the price to fill empty rooms and they have to pay the money back to Triprebel? I'm not sure how that will work with the hotels.""
Travel industry consultant, Ian Mackinnon thinks this could prove an obstacle: ""I think this will probably lead to a change whereby hotels will ask you for a deposit at the point of booking.""
Some independent hotels have already rebelled against the existing price comparison sites by guaranteeing that only guests that book rooms directly with them can access the lowest room prices.
Mr Borges - who says he founded Triprebel after struggling to organise a group holiday for 10 friends - says pushback from parts of the hotel sector will not upset his overall business strategy.
""We're building Triprebel as a shopping assistant,"" he explains as he wrestles a football from the mouth of the boisterous office dog.
""The end goal is that consumers can come to us, state the purchase intention and we go out there and buy the right product at the right time, considering not only hotels but the whole travel experience, from the flights to the car rental, to the hotel to the activities at the destination.""

"Kirsty Williams told them they have a ""responsibility as stewards of community, city and country"", at a speech in Cardiff.
The referendum showed ""notions of togetherness"" were ""perhaps weaker than we imagined"", she warned academics.
The Conservatives said she had offered some ""nuggets of wisdom"" but was ""exaggerating a sense of crisis"".
Universities and the Ms Williams campaigned for the UK to remain an EU member before the vote in June.
However, Brexit was backed by 52.5% of voters in Wales, with 47.5% supporting Remain.
On Monday, First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales must get away from the abuse and bitterness of the referendum campaign.
Speaking at Cardiff University on Thursday, Ms Williams claimed there was an ""urgency"" for universities to ""recapture a civic mission"" after the Leave vote.
She suggested the existence of much of what is taken for granted in modern life might not be as secure as many people believe.
""The victories that help bend the arc of history towards progress - feminism, opening up access to education, civility in our discourse and towards others, civil rights, even devolution - may be far more fragile than we imagined,"" Ms Williams said.
""The vote showed that when people and communities think advancements are for the benefit of others - rather than for them, their families or society at large - they will think they have nothing to lose by standing against these.""
Urging colleges to do more to reach out to people across Wales, Ms Williams said the referendum exposed the ""distance between campus and community"".
She warned: ""At a UK-level, the pro-EU campaign of universities was too easily dismissed as one of self-interest, almost exclusively focused on income.
""This is not to exempt politicians and government from criticism, far from it. But it is certainly incumbent on universities to reflect on the distance between campus and community exposed by the referendum.""
Ms Williams has also announced she is establishing a Welsh Higher Education Brexit Working Group, to advise on the ""impact and possibilities"" arising from the UK's departure from the European Union.
Six years ago the then Education Minister Leighton Andrews said university governance was ""the last resting place of the crachach"" - elitist and detached from mainstream Welsh society.
In her first big address to university bosses, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams's tone was distinctly less confrontational.
But her more nuanced message still displayed a view in government that institutions getting millions in public money should do more for their communities and the nation.
""They can't hide behind the walls of their very fine buildings - they have to be a part of the communities in which they are placed and the country as a whole - they recognise that,"" she told me afterwards.
The EU referendum - in which the universities argued strongly to stay in - is one example of the divide between campus and community, she says.
The universities' response is to say they are committed to bridging the gap and will build on what they already do in their communities.
And both government and universities will hope the Diamond Review on higher education finance, due to report later this month, will go some way to resolving the tensions between them over funding.
Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar accused the minister of ""exaggerating a sense of crisis and division"".
""There are some nuggets of wisdom in this speech, and few would argue that the gap between campus and community has widened over the course of a generation,"" he said.
""However, the suggestion that Wales' decision to leave the EU has somehow placed education, civil rights or feminism under threat is absolute nonsense.""
Cardiff University vice chancellor Prof Colin Riordan, who chairs Universities Wales, said:  ""Being part of and contributing to community has always been at the heart of what we do as universities.""
He added: ""We are proud of our successes, but we can do more to embrace and appreciate the cultural and social diversity of the communities within which we sit.""","Universities should help re-unite Welsh society after the Brexit vote, the education secretary has said.",37299382
"Dylan Marcus Edwards, 50, from Llanrwst in Conwy county, admitted causing suffering to Cali the cat which was put in a bag and hit with a piece of wood.

There had been a furious local backlash following the cat's death and an online petition calling for those responsible to be prosecuted attracted more than 35,700 supporters.
Melissa Griffiths, defending, said Edwards had been dismissed from his job after 32 years working at the hotel.
""He's been vilified since and has become a hermit in his own home, afraid to go out because of the strength of feeling against him,"" said Ms Griffiths.
""He's been verbally abused and refused service in his local village. He wrongly believed the cat was not a protected animal because it was feral.""
Edwards was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and pay Â£865 costs.
The court also heard the case against another 36-year-old man had been dropped.

"People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) wants the mascot to be replaced with a modern animal-friendly version.
The group has suggested a fish with the slogan Skegness - A Happy Plaice.
The mayor of Skegness said all suggestions were welcome but said he did not think there would be much support for Jolly to be axed.
The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness.
The poster featured the slogan ""Skegness is so bracing"".
It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort.
However, Dawn Carr, of Peta, said Jolly ""evokes images of cruelty to animals"".
""Fish being tricked into impaling themselves in the mouth, animals being pulled out of the ocean in giant nets where they are so crushed together the pressure pushes their stomachs out through their mouths and their eyes pop out.""
""This is what the Jolly Fisherman represents,"" she said.
She said Peta's suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination.
""One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated.""
Skegness's mayor, Carl Macey, said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike.
He said: ""Animal cruelty is something we don't want to be portrayed for, but I don't feel Jolly has ever come across in that manner.

"Leg-spinner Mason Crane, called into the England Test squad earlier in the day, took 3-21 as the hosts restricted Glamorgan to 118-6 on a slow pitch.
Captain James Vince (60 not out) saw Hampshire home with six overs to spare.
Meanwhile, Middlesex prevailed in a tight finish at Lord's as Sussex, who needed five runs from the last over for victory, could only manage two.
Middlesex posted 147-6 thanks to Stevie Eskinazi's 57 not out from 44 balls and Paul Stirling's 40 from 31, as England seamer Chris Jordan (2-29) impressed.
Sussex began their chase well thanks to Chris Nash (64), but only he and Stiaan van Zyl (34) reached double figures as they slumped from 125-4 in the 17th over to 140-7 - with eight runs needed from the final nine balls of the innings.
That meant a nervy last over, bowled by seamer Tom Helm - but he began with two dot balls, had Jofra Archer caught off the third, and David Wiese could only manage a two off the fifth ball as Helm held his nerve and Middlesex sneaked home by two runs.
It leaves both South Group sides in mid-table on 10 points from 11 games.
Meanwhile, Hampshire's spin-heavy tactics were clear from the start with Crane, fellow leg-spinner Shahid Afridi and slow left-armer Liam Dawson taking a combined 6-52 from their 12 overs of spin.
Dawson - left out of the Test squad in favour of Crane - took the new ball and made an immediate impact, bowling Aneurin Donald with the third ball of the match.
Glamorgan's top order could not get going and only a stand of 53 in the final 6.3 overs between Andrew Salter (37 not out) and Graham Wagg (15 not out) gave them any respectability.
But despite losing debutant wicketkeeper Calvin Dickinson in the first over, Hampshire always looked in control of an easy run chase.
Vince's unbeaten 60 came off just 41 balls and featured 10 fours, while he was ably assisted by Tom Alsop (28 from 19) and George Bailey (25 not out).

He and the driver were rescued by the emergency services from the rubble. The 54-year-old driver has been released after treatment.
The lorry has been removed from the building and has been taken away to undergo further tests that will help establish the cause of the crash.

""Engineers and contractors have started work to secure the affected buildings and it is expected that a partial demolition may be required to ensure the site is made safe,"" the council said in a statement.
""The council has agreed that contractors can work into and through the night, if necessary.
""It is hoped that this will allow the A78 to re-open early next week.""
The council said it had arranged for letters to be delivered to all 600 households in Fairlie informing them of the situation and making them aware that some noise disturbance is likely through the night while work is ongoing.
The statement added: ""The council has apologised in advance for any disturbance which may be caused.""
Fairlie Community Council has been campaigning for road improvements in the area.
It has argued that the route is not suitable for traffic that includes lorries heading to Hunterston power station.
Councillor John Ferguson, North Ayrshire Council's cabinet member for infrastructure, said: ""While responsibility for management of the A78 trunk road lies with Transport Scotland, the council has lobbied - and will continue to lobby - for improvements to the road.

"Highways England wants turn the hard shoulder into an extra lane between junction three by Heathrow Airport and junction 12 at Theale to tackle periods of heavy congestion.
The scheme, costing up to Â£862m, will improve traffic flow and ensure ""less stressful driving"", supporters say.
Opponents claim it will increase congestion and affect the environment.
The motorways are called ""smart"" because technology will be installed to monitor traffic, provide information to drivers, and ease congestion by using variable speed limits and utilising the hard shoulder.
""Emergency Refuge Areas"" will be put in place every 2.5 km (1.6 miles) so drivers can come off the hard shoulder and await recovery.
The first one was introduced on the M42 near Birmingham in 2006 and there is now also one on the stretch of M4/M5 near Bristol.
Chief scientist Alan Stevens at the Transport Research Laboratory in Crowthorne, which carries out modelling for the smart motorways, said: ""They help the traffic go better, drivers get shorter and more predictable journeys and less stressful driving.
""We did a lot of modelling work and put people into driving simulators to see how they would respond, and actually we found no problems at all.""
John Booth from Reading Friends of the Earth said smart motorways are not the solution to congestion.
""The reason they're doing this is they want to cater for more traffic on the motorway and will encourage more traffic growth, and that will have a knock on effect on air quality, on climate change emissions, on noise and on congestion on the non-motorway network,"" he said.

"The former world champion will target the time trial and may also support Lizzie Armitstead in the road race.
Pooley, 33, retired from cycling after winning two silver medals at the 2014 Commonwealth Games to concentrate on triathlon and other endurance events.
""This is a truly rare opportunity that I can't resist,"" she said.
Pooley won silver in the time trial at the 2008 Beijing Olympics before finishing sixth in the event at London 2012, where she also helped Armitstead win a silver medal in the road race.
The 29.8km time trial course in Rio features the 1.2km, 7% average gradient Grumari climb and the ""impressively hilly nature"" of the terrain persuaded Pooley, renowned for her climbing abilities, to come out of retirement and target a gold medal.
""I've decided it's worth a serious attempt at targeting that event,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday.
""If I can prove to both myself and the GB team selectors that I have the capacity to win the time trial in Rio, I'll compete for selection for the Olympic team - I'm happy knowing I won't get selected unless I really do have the potential to win.
""I have no desire to go to the Rio Games, and sacrifice some of the most exciting triathlon races of the season, just for the experience of another Olympics - I'm committed to aiming for gold.""
After turning to multi-sport events in August 2014, Pooley won the world long-distance duathlon title at the first attempt a month later, breaking the course record by 16 minutes.
She successfully defended her crown in September and is aiming to make it three consecutive wins next year, adding that long-distance triathlon and duathlon remain her ""main focus"" in 2016.
Yet after studying the Rio courses, British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton says he approached Pooley about a return, believing she could also improve world champion Armistead's chances of winning gold in the road race.
""I'm really pleased that Emma saw the value in the opportunity and is back with us,"" he added.
""Having her talent and experience in the team enhances our medal prospects in the time trial and Lizzie Armitstead's opportunity to win the road race.

"Labour's new leader said he wanted the weekly sessions to be less ""theatrical"" and Mr Cameron agreed there should be more focus on ""substantial issues"".
Mr Corbyn asked about housing, tax credits and mental health service cuts.
The BBC's Norman Smith said it was much calmer than normal but the PM had not been put under any real pressure.
Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg later on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn insisted he would not campaign for the UK to leave the European Union, while vowing to fight any moves towards a more free-market relationship.
Mr Corbyn was cheered by Labour MPs as he got to his feet at his first PMQs, before launching into a lengthy pre-amble in which he thanked supporters for his Labour leadership victory, vowed to make PMQs less ""theatrical"" and explained his decision to crowd source his questions.
He said: ""I thought at my first PMQs, I would do it in a slightly different way... So I sent out an email to thousands of people and asked them what questions they would like to put to the prime minister and I received 40,000 replies.""
The prime minster congratulated Mr Corbyn on his ""resounding victory"" in the Labour leadership contest and welcomed him to the frontbench.
Mr Cameron, who began his own career as opposition leader in 2005 promising to end ""Punch and Judy"" politics, then said ""no one would be more delighted than me"" if PMQs could become a ""genuine exercise in asking questions and answering questions"".
Mr Corbyn's first question ""from a woman called Marie"" was on the ""chronic lack of affordable housing"" and ""the extortionate rents charged by some private sector landlords"" - something the new Labour leader has said will be his top priority.
Mr Cameron said the government had delivered more affordable homes but recognised ""much more needs to be done"".
Before Mr Corbyn began his second question, on job losses at housing associations, he thanked the prime minister ""for his commitment that we are going to do Prime Minister's Questions in a more adult way than it's been done in the past"".
He then asked about ""absolutely shameful"" cuts to tax credits voted through by MPs on Tuesday, on behalf of  ""Paul,"" and about cuts to mental health services, prompted by a question from ""Gail"".
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's verdict
As promised, it was different. A parliamentary revolution in beige, Jeremy Corbyn's new leader's navy suit, no where to be seen.  It wasn't so much Jeremy Corbyn's questions to the prime minister but Gail, Marie, Steven, and Angela's questions.
What's also different? Camp Corbyn and David Cameron's team are both happy with the outcome of the crucial half hour of PMQs, the new Labour leader's first ever outing at the despatch box.
Read Laura's full analysis
Mr Cameron struck a consensual tone in his replies, agreeing that more needed to be done to improve mental health services, and paused to scold Labour MPs who were jeering him over his claim that the lowest paid would be Â£20 a week better off next year thanks to an increase in the minimum wage.
""I thought this was the new Question Time. I'm not sure the message has fully got home,"" he told them.
The prime minister took a couple of swipes at the new Labour leader when answering questions from backbenchers, as noise levels in the chamber returned to normal levels, although Tory MPs still appeared to be following instructions to avoid triumphalism.
In response to a question on Northern Ireland from DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Mr Cameron paid tribute to former Conservative MPs Airey Neave and Ian Gow, who were murdered by Republican terrorists.
He did not directly refer to controversy over Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell's previous comments on Northern Ireland, but said: ""I have a simple view, which is the terrorism we faced was wrong, it was unjustifiable, the death and the killing was wrong. It was never justified and people who seek to justify it should be ashamed of themselves.""
He held back from attacking Mr Corbyn over his much-criticised decision not to sing the national anthem at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, saying in response to a question from a Tory MP that the St Paul's Cathedral event had been ""a reminder of how proud we should be of our armed forces, then, today and always.""
Minutes before the session began Labour sources confirmed that their leader, who believes in the abolition of the monarchy, would join in with the anthem at future official engagements.
Labour denied that Mr Corbyn's new approach - asking six different questions rather than pushing the prime minister on a single point - gave Mr Cameron an easy ride.
""The questions were very direct and they demanded clear answers,"" a Labour source said.
Asked about policy differences that appear to have emerged between Mr Corbyn and his front bench, on welfare cuts and Europe, a Labour source said ""lots of listening"" would be done and some policies would be reviewed under the new leadership.","Jeremy Corbyn asked David Cameron questions emailed to him from the public as he tried what he called ""a different"" style for his debut PMQs.",34264683

"Public Health Wales (PHW) said 21 of the 35 residents at the unidentified home had been ill since 10 April.
It is unclear if the flu-like illness caused the death.
Earlier this week, it was revealed that two people had died after a flu outbreak at two Swansea nursing homes.
Public health officials said five residents had been hospitalised and the remainder had been offered the anti-viral drug, Tamiflu.
Carmarthenshire council, which runs the home, said it was working very closely with PHW.
Dr Mac Walapu, consultant in communicable disease control for PHW, said: ""In view of the rapid spread and high attack rate of this illness, it is most likely to be influenza.
""We have also recently had outbreaks of influenza in nursing homes in Swansea.
""Flu circulates in the UK between October and April and is not uncommon to see outbreaks in closed communities like nursing homes, where the disease can spread easily.""
Dr Walapu said people with flu would usually experience a fever, chills, headache, body aches and fatigue, and fit and healthy people would usually recover without any complications and without needing medication.
""However, in elderly people flu can be more serious and therefore we have treated residents at this home with Tamiflu as a precaution,"" he added.
Sheila Porter, Carmarthenshire council's head of primary, community and social care, said they were working very closely with PHW to support residents, visitors and staff by providing information, advice and reassurance.
""Sadly, one of our residents has passed away and although the death is not confirmed as linked to the flu-like illness, we extend our deepest sympathies to the family who we will continue to support,"" she added.

"The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy.
The Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government.
The discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020.
The Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:
Taking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do.
Jeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour.
It is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election.
Looking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy.
More likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this.
An amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections.
In short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.","With the permission of the Queen, prime ministers used to be able to call a general election at a time of their choosing.",37876851

"Benjamin Netanyahu said he would raise renewing sanctions when he meets US President Donald Trump in February.
Iran has carried out several such tests since a 2015 nuclear deal which relaxed sanctions against the country.
It is not yet clear what type of missile was launched, or if it explicitly violated the UN resolution.
A 2010 resolution, which barred Iran from undertaking any work on ""ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads"", was terminated after the nuclear deal with six world powers was implemented.
It was replaced by a new resolution, 2231, that ""calls upon"" Iran not to undertake any activity related to ""ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons"".
The UN Security Council is to hold a meeting on Tuesday about the missile launch, at the request of the US.
In a recorded message on his Facebook page, Mr Netanyahu said ""Iranian aggression must not go unanswered"".
Mr Netanyahu is a fierce critic of the nuclear deal with Iran, which calls for the eradication of the Jewish state.
Benjamin Netanyahu's condemnation of the Iranian missile test is clearly intended to push the new Trump administration to take action against Tehran.
Iran will be high on the agenda when the two men meet in mid-February, though it is as much Iran's regional activities as its missile programme that worries the Israelis.
Iran's missile tests are controversial. While they do not break the terms of the nuclear deal between Iran and the major powers - this did not cover missile development - they may well be a violation of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
The Iranians insist that, since they have no plans for nuclear weapons, the tests are not prohibited.
Iran's launch may well force Mr Trump to give a clearer indication of what practical steps he intends to take against Tehran.
Iran has not commented directly on the missile launch. When asked about it at a news conference on Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said only that ""the missile issue is not part of the nuclear deal"".
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but world powers suspect it of seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
The White House said it was studying the details of the incident.
US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the missile had broken up before the test was completed.
But US Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the foreign relations committee, said: ""No longer will Iran be given a pass for its repeated ballistic missile violations.""
Mr Trump has previously called the Iran nuclear deal ""a disaster"" and suggested his administration will abandon it.
But that has drawn criticism from senior figures, including the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Brennan.

"The Reverend Gavin Ashenden, a senior clergyman in the Church of England, left his position as chaplain in order to be free to criticise the move.
A passage from the Koran was read during an Epiphany service at St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow earlier this month.
Mr Ashenden said the reading had caused ""serious offence"".
The cathedral has said it is standing by its decision.
St Mary's invited local Muslims, who also revere Jesus as a prophet, to join the service.
A student, Madinah Javed, read from the lectern in Arabic from the chapter of Maryam, or Mary.
The chapter tells the story of the birth of Christ to the virgin Mary, and includes the Islamic teaching that Jesus is not the son of God and should not be worshipped.
Mr Ashenden told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme: ""The problem with what happened in Glasgow was that, although it was presented as a way of building bridges and a way of educating people, it was done badly, in the wrong way, in the wrong place, in the wrong context.
""There are a number of members of the congregation who have written open letters complaining of the profound upset they experienced as people who are part of the Eucharistic community who had come to worship Christ.""

Nevertheless, he is a keen photographer who works hard to capture ""the best shot I can"".

"Members of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from more than 100 countries marched five abreast into Saint Peter's Basilica on a cold winter's day under a cloudless sky, squinting in the bright sunlight.
The knights were hatless, but wore long black woollen cloaks with the distinctive eight-pointed white cross of their order embroidered in front.
The dames (about 30% of the members are now women), wearing similar robes and coiffed with black mantillas, followed behind.
The procession, including aid workers and volunteers bringing up the rear, took more than half an hour to wind around the basilica, into the square and up the steps into Saint Peter's.
At the high altar Pope Benedict's number two, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, led a special Mass to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the founding of the order by Brother Gerard, a Benedictine monk who opened a hospital for sick and poor pilgrims in Jerusalem at the time of the Crusades.
In 1113 Pope Paschal II formally recognised the independence of the Knights with a Papal bull, the original of which is still held in Malta's National Archives.
The Knights have had a long history of displacement around the Mediterranean.
After being evicted from Jerusalem by Saladin towards the end of the 12th Century, they set up a new headquarters in Cyprus, and subsequently on the island of Rhodes where they created an independent state.
During the Middle Ages they were more warriors than hospitallers. For two centuries they were the masters of Malta but they were again evicted, this time by Napoleon who occupied the island on his way to Egypt.
They finally settled in Rome in 1834, where they continue to enjoy many of the privileges of statehood, such as the power to appoint and receive ambassadors, print stamps, and issue passports, without actually having a real state to govern.
Today the Knights are a unique sovereign entity in that they rule over no territory except a palace in one of Rome's smartest shopping districts, a church and an elegant villa overlooking the city.
They have observer status at the United Nations, just like the Vatican, and Pope Benedict is a member of the monastic order, having joined 15 years ago.
He gave his blessing to the knights at the end of the Vatican Mass urging them to continue their work for the world's neediest people.
He reminded them that they are not practising ""mere philanthropy"" but must always stay true to the order's original Christian ideals, and to Church teaching.
The order's international headquarters is in a palace situated in Rome's Via Condotti, a short distance from the Spanish Steps. High fashion boutiques nearby offer neat handbags for sale at prices ranging up to $3,000.
The atmosphere inside reminded me of an Oxbridge College or a London Club. Inside the porter's lodge there are cubby holes for letters addressed to His Highness, the Grand Master - who is British - and to senior officials.
Matthew Festing is an expert on 17th Century European painting. He used to run the Northern England office of the auction house Sotheby's before being elected for life five years ago to become the leader of the Knights of Malta.
He now enjoys the title of prince, and holds the equivalent rank of a Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.
Sitting in his cosy private apartment decorated with gold brocade wall coverings, fine antique furniture and paintings, he explained to me how the Knights are changing.
""The fact that we are called Knights is a function of the past really,"" he said. ""We were originally recruited from the aristocratic families of Europe.""
The order has now become a worldwide organisation, and it tries to attract the most talented people from many areas outside Europe.
""We have a very different makeup from what we did perhaps 50 years or 500 years ago, but fundamentally the talents we are trying to attract for our members are the same,"" Mr Festing said.","Four thousand Knights of Malta, heirs to one of the great orders of European chivalry of mediaeval times, and the fourth oldest religious order in the Roman Catholic Church, took over the Vatican briefly on Saturday.",21396696

Tries by Tom Habberfield and Tyler Ardron, converted by Dan Biggar, gave the home team a 14-point interval lead.
Ulster dominated after the break, but Brendan Leonard's try saw the game off before Jacob Stockdale's late score.
Ospreys need a point in their final game to secure a play-off spot while Ulster will have to beat Leinster for any chance of making the final stages.
They face Scarlets on 6 May with the west Wales region secure in the play-off places after a 30-8 win over Connacht.
Fifth-placed Ulster will need a miracle to overtake to overtake Ospreys in fourth place and will regret the number of missed opportunities after the break in Swansea if - as now seems likely - they fail to make the play-offs.
Stockdale beat most of the defence, only to see his final pass go to ground and later kicked the ball over the dead-ball line after outstripping the cover.
Charles Piutau dropped the ball close to the Ospreys' line as Ulster put the home team under pressure.
But the visitors were made to pay for their profligacy when substitute Leonard crossed for the Ospreys' third try two minutes before time in a rare second-half attack.
When Stockdale scored practically from the re-start, it left Ulster looking for a second try and conversion to claim a losing bonus point - only to lose possession at a breakdown for the umpteenth time.
Ospreys - coming into the game after three successive league defeats - weathered an early storm and scored from practically their first attack as centre Ashley Beck tied in two defenders to send the unmarked Habberfield over in the corner.
Paddy Jackson and Biggar exchanged penalties before the Welsh side took control in the lead up to half-time with only a combination of good Ulster defence and their own lack of composure keeping Ospreys at bay.
But on the stroke of half-time a long kick by Jackson saw home full-back and man-of-the-match Dan Evans carve the defence open before handing on to Habberfield who put Ardron over between the posts.
The conversion opened a 14-point gap which better reflected Ospreys' dominance.
It was Ulster's turn to dominate in the second half, but mistakes and stubborn defending left them wondering what might have been - and facing an almighty challenge in the final game at home to Leinster.
Ulster scrum-half Ruan Pienaar, who leaves at the end of the season,  may have played his last game for the province after suffering a back spasm which saw him leave the field during the first half.
Ulster director of rugby Les Kiss said: ""Frustrated and disappointed - two words that describe a lot of things because there's a fair bit of pain in that dressing room.
""Ruan [Pienaar] had a back spasm before the game started, he said he'd ride it out but within 20 minutes it was gone. It's a fairly significant spasm and those things can take a while.
""Stu McCloskey had a bad dead leg and Stuart Olding was hit hard with his first touch with an ankle injury, it's probably season-ending.""

"Foredowne Boarding Kennel is facing allegations about how dogs, seized by Devon and Cornwall Police and placed there, were kept without exercise.
The licensing authority, Teignbridge Council, said it was investigating.
The kennel said it was staffed by ""animal lovers who work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs"".
The RSPCA announced on Friday it had agreed with the Devon and Cornwall Police force's request to review the way in which dogs seized under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 were cared for in kennels.
Whistleblowers have made a series of allegations about dogs being put in 3ft by 9ft cages and then, due to safety concerns, not exercised.
These include Stella, who had been caged for nearly two years, and Vinnie, a Rottweiler who whistleblowers said had also not been exercised.
The BBC has also been told that three puppies, brought in at 11-weeks old, were briefly walked before being denied exercise. Further claims have been made that stray dogs brought in by local councils were also denied exercise.
Devon and Cornwall Police are understood to have used the kennels to place a number of seized dogs but said since 2012 they had only instructed staff not to exercise four of these.
However, current and former members of staff have said as many as 20 dogs had 'Do Not Enter' signs on their cages.
Former kennel manager David Clark said in the three years he worked there he did not see those dogs exercised.
A spokesman for the kennels said: ""The puppies were walked regularly, as part of their kennel enrichment activities. However, we carry out regular risk assessments, and for these particular dogs, as they came into maturity they started to show signs of aggression.
""We did have to stop the walks during the final few weeks of their stay with us.
""One member of staff was bitten and, of course, we do have to take into account the breed characteristics of their parents, both very dangerous dogs.""
The spokesman said the kennels had cared for many dogs over the years, and had ""an excellent working relationship with Devon and Cornwall Police"".
The spokesman said: ""We are animal lovers and work tirelessly to care and rehabilitate the dogs that come to us from the police, but unfortunately sometimes the risks are too great.
""We would of course welcome and fully support any investigation by the council or RSPCA. We are confident that we have abided by all the relevant rules and regulations.""
A spokeswoman for Teignbridge District Council said: ""We take all complaints of animal welfare seriously and will be carrying out an investigation into the specific allegations that have been made.""
Pit bulls Smokey and Lola were seized by police from the same owner over suspicions that the dogs were trained to attack. Their three puppies were seized at the same time.
Mr Clark said: ""The three pit bull terrier pups came in at 11 weeks. They were initially exercised before deteriorating so much they were deemed unsafe.
""The police were informed and they went on to do at least six months with no exercise.""
In a statement, Ch Supt Jim Nye said: ""Since 2012, we have seized and placed into kennels in the region of 200 dogs, of which only four were given a strict order not to exercise by Devon and Cornwall Police due to the dog's unpredictable and dangerous nature.""
He said they included Stella, Gnasha - another pit bull, Smokey and Lola.
A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police added: ""As regards any other dogs the kennel has chosen not to walk during this time - there may be some - that is a decision made by the kennel as part of their duty of care for the animals they have.
""While we have individual care plans for all dogs which we have seized, ultimately the kennel maintains this duty of care.""",A kennel used by police and local councils to house stray and seized dogs is facing two reviews into its treatment of animals.,35745344

"Andrew Shinnie, James Keatings and Chris Humphrey banged in three goals inside 13 first-half minutes.
The Midlothian junior side had a moment to celebrate when Dean Hoskins converted a penalty.
The one-way traffic continued in the second half with Jason Cummings scoring twice, while Lewis Stevenson, Keatings and Jordon Forster were also on target.
The opening 10 minutes were evenly matched but a goalkeeping error gifted Hibs their opener and it encouraged the Leith side to go on a three-goal blitz at the home of their arch-rivals Hearts.
Shinnie's 22-yard shot looked like it would be dealt with comfortably by Michael Andrews, but the low effort squirmed through his grasp and into the bottom right corner.
Bonnyrigg's 5000-strong support remained noisy before Keatings' delightful strike into the top left corner punctured their enthusiasm. Goalkeeper Andrews could do nothing about that one and all of a sudden the pressure was on the underdogs not to fold, but a third Hibs goal followed soon after.
Andrews palmed Stevenson's low shot into the path of Humphrey for the winger to stroke home an easy first goal of his Hibs career.
Manager Robbie Horn signalled to his players to be big and to stand up to Hibs' dominance, and left-back Ruaridh Donaldson impressed under pressure on more than one occasion before playing a useful ball to Kieran McGachie. Forster fouled the ambling blonde forward and referee Alan Muir pointed to the spot.
Dean Hoskins sent Hibs' substitute goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw the wrong way and all of a sudden the Rosey Posey's support rediscovered their fervour, flags and volume.
Another shout for a penalty from a Forster handball, as well as Wayne McIntosh's header wide gave the New Dundas Park side some hope of scoring a second, but Neil Lennon's side also remained a threat and Hoskins had to be smart to clear off the line before the break.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Hibernian quickly killed off any thoughts of an unlikely comeback with Cummings' scissor-kick and Stevenson's back post tap-in well and truly wrapping the result up by the hour mark.
Bonnyrigg were broken further by Cummings' second strike of the game - an easy finish when Andrews could only parry an effort from Grant Holt. Then Keatings completed his brace by converting into the far corner from a tight angle following Martin Boyle's through ball.
The rout was complete when Forster got in the scoring act by heading home Keatings' free-kick after a reckless foul by Hoskins on Humphrey.
A chastening experience on the day for Bonnyrigg but one they only experienced because of a terrific run in the competition.
Hibernian's Neil Lennon: ""The attitude was great and that will give the players a lift. Overall, I'm very pleased and the most important thing is that we are in the next round.
""It was a good day. Unfortunately, we lost our goalkeeper early [Ofir Marciano after a collision], so we are waiting to hear the results of that and we're hoping it's not too bad.""
Bonnyrigg's Robbie Horn: ""We just didn't start the game and we gave away some poor goals. I know we are better than that.
""We showed in spells what we are capable of at 3-0 and I thought there was a good shout for another penalty to go 3-2.

"Some fans and politicians were angry that poppies were not worn by players.
In a statement, Ulster Rugby said several other Pro12 clubs had not worn a poppy during games at the weekend.
It said its players had observed a minute's silence and it would hold a memorial service on Tuesday.
The Belfast Telegraph reported that some fans had described the absence as ""shameful"".
Robert McCartney, a former soldier who runs the Beyond the Battlefield charity, told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme it was ""an insult"".
""I honestly believe they did cause an insult yesterday,"" he said.
""It is a mark of respect, the reason they are able to play the sport themselves is because of the freedom these men gave them and if they can't put the poppy on their shirt for one day and show that respect, then they really did disgrace themselves yesterday.

Doug Beattie, an Ulster Unionist councillor and former army captain, said he believed remembrance was a ""personal thing"".
""The Ulster Rugby team had a remembrance service on that day, they had a minute's silence before the match and everybody is complaining about the symbolism of wearing a poppy, well I just don't get it,"" he added.
""I don't like the word poppy fascism or poppy Stalinism, there are people who are passionate about the poppy and remembrance and me and Robert have got more in common than we don't, but on this issue I feel that people should wear the poppy if they want to wear the poppy if they don't then they should not.
""I would rather stand beside somebody who is wearing it for a reason than somebody who is wearing it because somebody has told them if you don't you are unpatriotic.""

"It comes after a jury concluded the death of a man from St Austell was suicide, while undergoing care 140 miles from where he lived.
David Knight was killed by a train near St Austell after going on leave from a Somerset hospital.
The Department of Health has admitted ""unacceptable"" patients ""are receiving care far from home"".
Click here for live updates on this story
BBS South West Political Reporter Tamsin Melville said county coroner Dr Emma Carlyon was understood to be satisfied there was a commitment locally to continue to work hard to ensure the lowest number of patients possible leave the county for treatment.
An inquest in June heard that in May last year Mr Knight died of multiple injuries when he was hit by a train on the viaduct.
The 29-year-old had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia when he died.
A jury said his death was contributed to by an inadequate risk assessment and support while he was on leave from Cygnet Hospital in Kewstoke, Somerset.
The inquest heard Mr Knight was being treated there because there were no acute psychiatric inpatient beds available in Cornwall.
The NHS said 30 adult mental patients were placed out of Cornwall in 2015/16, 150 the year before when a key unit was closed for six months, and 60 the year before that.
The Department of Health said it had increased mental health funding to Â£11.7bn and had accepted the recommendation of the Mental Health Taskforce that the inappropriate use of out of area treatments for adults in acute care ""must be eliminated by 2020/21"".

""You do feel in the third year that you should see the fruits of your labour,"" said Mott.
""We have built a squad over the last couple of years and this is the year where we should be looking to improve a helluva lot.
""Last year, we made some improvements towards the back end, but it was too little, too late.
""This month of April is very important for everyone at the club and in Wales. We have to start to show what we have got.""
Glamorgan lost James Harris, who is one of four uncapped players in England's ICC Champions Trophy provisional squad, after he agreed to join Middlesex on a three-year contract at the end of last season.
Veteran Robert Croft also retired after 23 seasons with the Welsh county.
Seam bowler Harris triggered a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave Glamorgan, who gave him his first-class debut as a 16-year-old in 2007, if the Welsh county were not in the top tier.
Mott has returned from a 10-day pre-season tour of South Africa with Glamorgan and is convinced his squad are ready to learn the lessons of  last seasons's disappointing campaign.
""We need to improve across the board,"" said Mott.
""A realistic goal is to win more games than we lose and we didn't get close to that last year.
""If we get close to that, just like any side in this division, it can come down to the last couple of games and you are challenging, but we have to start the season better.
""We finished well last season but our start really killed us and our promotion aspirations.""
Glamorgan have added Australian bowler Michael Hogan and Zimbabwean batsman Murray Goodwin to their squad this year.
Australian Marcus North is to lead the one-day side, while his countryman, pace bowler Dirk Nannes, has been signed to play in the Friends Life T20.
On Friday, Glamorgan play their final pre-season friendly with a three-day match against Cardiff MCCU.

"Scott Ludlam, 46, who is deputy leader of the Australian Greens party, made the announcement in a Facebook post.
He said he had been dealing with mental health issues ""for a while"".
""I will return to work as soon as I'm able to give the commitment the work demands,"" Senator Ludlam wrote.
""I am fortunate to be getting the very best of care from my friends and family, and my health professionals,"" he added.
Figures from across Australian politics wished Mr Ludlam well on social media, praising his honesty.
""Wishing my dear friend and colleague @SenatorLudlam all the best for a speedy recovery. We love you Scott,"" Australian Greens chief Richard Di Natale tweeted.
Western Australia Labor Leader Mark McGowan wrote: ""Thinking of you @SenatorLudlam. A brave thing to do today. All WA parliamentarians wish you the very best. MM.""
As the news spread on Twitter, many Australians spoke of their respect for the Greens leader, suggesting that his openness would help others who are fighting mental health battles.
During his absence, Senator Ludlam will be offered a ""pair"" in the Australian Senate. This means a single vote on the opposing side of debates will be cancelled out for as long as he is on leave.
Mr Ludlam is a popular figure among young left-wingers in Australia, and has been vocal about online privacy issues. In 2015 he branded the Australian government's new national security legislation a privacy invasion, and provided a list of ways for people to circumvent data retention laws.
The senator said his work for Western Australia - which includes communications, international aid, defence, foreign affairs and nuclear technology spheres - would be handled by ""senate colleagues"" and ""the team in my office"".
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, a large number of Australian MPs have admitted privately that they struggle to cope with alcoholism, feelings of isolation, and stress from marriage breakdowns or scandals.
Warren Entsch, a Liberal party leader and former MP, told the Herald he was left in ""absolute hell"" back in 1999 when the opposition Labor party were pursuing him over a defence contract they said was dodgy.
""I was sick. I was devastated. I had to go to Canberra Hospital for chest pains. There were a couple of days where I couldn't get off the couch in my office,"" he said.
""I always feel for someone who is getting beaten up by the media - what you go through from a mental health perspective is absolutely intense.""
Former MP Doctor Malcolm Washer, a qualified GP who was known as ""the doctor in the house"", has claimed there is a ""significant"" amount of depression among Australian politicians, adding that the job is ""very isolating"".
He has estimated that around 20% of people working in Parliament House are taking anti-depressants, and many more are on sleeping pills.
Mr Ludlam is not the first senior leader to go public about his depression. Former Liberal MP Andrew Robb took leave for six months in 2010 to address the condition, and is now a passionate advocate for mental health.
Scott Ludlam is one of a number of high-profile figures who have spoken about their mental health issues in recent days.
Singer Zayn Malik, a former member of the wildly successful boyband One Direction, has talked about his battle with ""extreme anxiety"", saying: ""Anxiety is something people don't necessarily want to advertise because it's seen, in a way, like a weakness.""
The 23-year-old said he had pulled out of several live performances earlier this year due to mental health struggles.

""I speak about it so that people understand that it doesn't matter what level of success you have, where you're from, who you are, what sex you are, what you do - you can still experience these things,"" Mr Malik told ES magazine.
Another world-famous singer, Adele, shared her experience of postnatal depression after the birth of her son Angelo.
She told Vanity Fair that while she ""loves her son more than anything"", she sometimes felt she had made ""the worst decision"" of her life as she struggled to adjust to motherhood.

"Cassie Sainsbury, 22, was stopped at an airport in Bogota on 12 April. She could face up to 25 years in jail, according to her sister, Khala.
The drugs were hidden inside 15 pairs of headphones that Ms Sainsbury bought during a holiday, the family said.
Ms Sainsbury's family claims she is innocent of drug trafficking charges.
Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed it was providing consular assistance, but did not give further details.
The personal trainer, from Adelaide, had just finished a working holiday when she was arrested at El Dorado International Airport, her family said.
Ms Sainsbury's mother, Lisa Evans, claimed her daughter was the ""naive"" victim of a Colombian man she had befriended during her trip.
""The day of her departure, he came up to her hotel, gave her a package that was wrapped in black plastic and she took it and put it in her luggage,"" she told Australian radio station KIIS FM.
""And this is where the naive bit comes in, she didn't even rip it open to make sure there were headphones in there.""
They said she was being held at El Buen Pastor, Colombia's largest women's prison.
The family has started an online campaign to help cover legal fees, raising A$2,600 (Â£1,500; $2,000) in four days.
Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs in Colombia are severe and offenders can expect long prison sentences under harsh conditions.
According to Ms Evans, Ms Sainsbury's lawyer has recommended a guilty plea to avoid a maximum sentence up to 25 years in jail.
If Ms Sainsbury pleads guilty, she would face a six-year sentence, which could be reduced further if she gives information about the man who supplied the headphones, Ms Evans said.
Colombia is one of the world's largest producers of coca leaves and cocaine.
Highly pure cocaine costs more than A$350 per gram in Australia, making it proportionally the most lucrative market in the world, according to the Global Drug Survey 2015,
According to a government website, Colombia's official working holiday visa may only be obtained by citizens of Chile, France, Mexico and Peru.","An Australian woman has been arrested in Colombia after being found with 5.8kg (12lb 13oz) of cocaine in her luggage, her family says.",39728709

"It is understood civil claims have been made against the car owners, even though they were not involved in the thefts or crashes.
The officers are claiming for injuries sustained when stopping the cars.
The owner's no-claims bonus can be affected and their car insurance premiums can increase as a result.
Bill Rooney is one of those affected. He had his car stolen from his north Belfast home last July.
He was still awake in the early hours of the morning when he heard his car being driven away from his house.
After a police chase, two men were arrested and his car was so badly damaged that it was written off.
He had arranged a new car through his insurance and believed the matter to be closed until he received an unexpected letter.
""I received a letter from a solicitor saying he was suing me for personal injuries on behalf of his client... and I later found out this client was a police officer who had been hurt when retrieving my car,"" he said.
""I was very angry and disheartened by the fact that a police officer was suing a victim.
""I'd already had my house broken into, I'd had my car stolen and I had had to replace it.
""I did feel sorry for the police officer if he was hurt doing his job but I felt that he should be insured in his own place of work.""
Mr Rooney's case has not yet been settled and he believes the police officer is prepared to take it to court.
The BBC has been unable to discover how many claims individual police officers have pursued or how much money they have received.
In a response to a Freedom of Information request, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they did not have a record of such claims.
""The PSNI would not hold any information in relation to police officers making a compensation claim against the owner of a stolen vehicle,"" they said.
""This would be a private matter between the officer and the solicitor and the information would not be recorded or required by police.
""Neither are they required to inform PSNI of their intention to pursue a claim.""
Stormont's justice committee, where the matter was first raised, also requested information from the PSNI.
In a letter, Supt Ryan Henderson said victims of car crime may or may not be penalised depending on their insurer and the terms of their policy.
He said that police officers, like any individual, could decide to pursue a claim through the Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) if they were in a crash where the driver of the other vehicle was at fault and could not be traced or was not insured.
""When claims against the MIB are settled, the MIB can seek to recover the cost incurred from the actual party at fault, i.e. the person who stole and was driving the vehicle,"" he said.
""In reality this probably seldom happens as car thieves do not generally have the financial assets to repay what MIB have had to pay out in damages and costs.
""It is a matter between the person who insures the vehicle and the insurance company as to whether or not in the event of their vehicle being stolen and involved in a collision, the insurance company will treat that incident as a claim under their policy.""
SDLP MLA Alban Maginness, who brought the matter to the attention of the justice committee, said two of his North Belfast constituents had received claims.
""Here are cases where victims of crime are actually penalised financially as a result of the act of criminals,"" he said.
""It seems to them and me to be totally unjust and quite unfair that they have to carry the burden of the criminal's actions.""",The owners of stolen cars are being sued by some police officers in Northern Ireland who were injured when chasing car thieves.,21168310

"Ashley Yates, 45, used a spy pen to record images of pupils and staff at The Tynings Primary School in Staple Hill, South Gloucestershire.
On Tuesday, at Bristol Crown Court, he admitted charges of making indecent images of children and voyeurism.
In a letter to parents the school said ""additional adult victims have been identified"" which the police confirmed.
On Tuesday the court heard Yates, of Filton, who is married with children, and had been in post as head at the school for eight years, filmed six girls, one boy and two members of staff.
It also heard Yates had handed over passwords to computers that would assist with the continuing police investigation.
A police spokesman said: ""Enquiries are ongoing and we will not be commenting until sentencing.""
But the letter to parents on the school's website says: ""Police have confirmed that additional adult victims have been identified.

""They have also been offered support from police and the local authority.

"Mr Spencer, head of Xbox, said the console, then codenamed Project Scorpio, “must deliver true 4K gaming and high-fidelity VR [virtual reality]”.
The Xbox One X, as it will now be known, looks set to deliver on that first promise of 4K visuals. But on the second? Virtual reality didn’t get a single mention at the company’s bonanza press event on Sunday.
So what’s happening?
I think it’s fair, despite the mild protests of his PR team afterwards, to characterise Mr Spencer as something of a virtual reality sceptic - at least for now.
“It’s important to listen to your customers and what they are actually looking for,” he told me.
“I don’t get many questions about consoles and mixed reality in the living room.
""When I do this on my PC, I’m closer to my PC - that seems to be a much more user-friendly scenario today.”
What he’s saying is - the technology isn’t quite there yet, in his view. Contrast that with Sony, whose PlayStation VR has sold more than one million headsets since being launched this time last year.
You’ll also notice that Mr Spencer talks about “mixed” reality, not “virtual”. The strategy from the very top at Microsoft is not in virtual worlds, but in augmented ones, where digital images are overlaid on to the real world.
Microsoft's Hololens augmented reality headset device, though still in its infancy, is perhaps the most exciting piece of consumer technology in development today - and Mr Spencer seems to buy into its potential, more so than VR.
“That’s where we see the most interest from customers and developers,” he said.
“We are believers in mixed reality. And mixed reality on the PC is something we’re focused on.”
Mr Spencer drew comparisons with Kinect, the motion-control device Microsoft released for the Xbox in 2010. Kinect was at first considered a big hit and around 24 million were eventually sold.
There are signs that Hololens and mixed reality could follow that same early trajectory, Mr Spencer said.
“We went through Kinect. We’ve seen what new ecosystems feel like when they’re catching momentum and really growing. We see that happening on Windows with mixed reality - that’s going to be our focus.”
But that Kinect comparison isn’t exactly ideal. Despite its early success - it was recognised by Guinness as the fastest selling consumer electronics device in history - you won’t see gamers excitedly gathering around a Kinect at E3 this year, and Microsoft has now abandoned bundling in the Kinect with the Xbox One console.
It was an innovative technology that ultimately lacked a practical application. In other words: it just didn’t really catch on.
Will virtual reality? If it does - Microsoft's choice to go down the mixed reality road could leave the Xbox platform bereft of gaming’s next big thing.","When introducing Microsoft’s newest Xbox console in 2016, Phil Spencer didn’t mince his words.",40245539
"The man was refused permission to take a case against the Department for the Economy, which plans to publish another list of RHI recipients next week.
He claimed it posed a risk of reputational damage to him and losses to his business.
But the department said the stated risk was ""tenuous in the extreme"" and it was within its rights to proceed.
The RHI scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources.
However, businesses have been receiving more in subsidies than they are paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed.
Boiler owners claim the subsidy is not simply profit, but also covers the cost of fuel and bank loans taken out to install the technology.
The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which at one point had a projected overspend of £490m, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March.
The applicant claimed the publication of recipients' details would not differentiate between those on a capped scheme and those who had benefitted from earlier, more generous tariffs.
The business owner, named only as WB, invested £100,000 in a boiler and was accredited to the scheme in January 2016.
That meant he was eligible only for payments limited by cost controls.
The court was told his first annual payment had been £5,200 - taking him just above the £5,000 limit under which companies are not named.
His barrister told the court his client could not ""avail of uncapped or untiered payments"", but the department was not drawing that distinction in the information it planned to publish.
He added that there was no ""potential for abuse"" in the capped scheme, so the public interest in publication of his details did not apply to the same extent.
But a barrister for the department said the date of application would be included in the information to be published.
He said that would allow the discerning reader to differentiate which tariff applied to the applicant.
And he said it would show the applicant had not sought to get into the scheme during a huge spike in applications in Autumn 2015.
The barrister said it was important that information was published ""wholesale"" so that the public could see the scheme's cost controls were working.
The department has already published a list of limited companies that receive RHI subsidies.
But under data protection regulations, they had to give people who had applied under their own names the opportunity to explain why their details should not be made public.
The deadline for receipt of that information expires on Wednesday.
The court heard the department planned to publish the information next week.
Since April 2017, all RHI recipients have been moved to the capped and tiered scheme.

"Her praise of menstrual leave - and suggestion that all women should be offered it - prompted a fiery debate among readers. Here is a selection of your experiences and opinions about the idea.
How can we say we want equality over pay and employment and then ask for a day's extra 'holiday' per month just for being a female? That's not asking for equality, that's saying women aren't as able to work as men, which surely kills all argument for equality... Guess what, I'm a female who has a period every month and I am still able to work as well as any man! If some women can't then that's their problem and they need to see a doctor! Charlotte Rachael, Halifax, UK
Personally, I suffer, for up to two weeks straight, I suffer. I've passed out through temporary anaemia at work. I've had to stop walking and hold on to a wall or a fence when walking to work. But I don't consider it necessary to call in sick, nor do I believe additional leave days should be required... We don't need additional leave, those who are suffering so badly need to push with their GPs to see a specialist. To award additional days leaves companies open to being taken advantage of by women who aren't suffering and just don't want to go to work for whatever reason. Lyndsey Victoria Corp, Barnsley, UK
Unfortunately, this is exactly why women make less money. Okay, well... it contributes. We are just gonna have to ""man up"" if we expect equality. Valerie Richardson, Oregon, US
The idea [of menstrual leave] makes sense to a degree, but surely unpaid leave will increase the wage gap (fewer hours means lower wages), which many people seem to take issue with. If it were to be paid leave, people who take the leave will either have to work harder to make up the time, or an earnings gap will develop, which is a much bigger problem than a wage gap, since fewer hours worked and equal wages means more money per hour worked for the same job, which is normally illegal. Obviously time off because of pain isn't a holiday, but it's simply not providing value to the company. I guess another alternative would be government subsidy, but I'm generally against too much of that in principle. Alex, Dundee, UK
I do sympathise with women who have a genuine problem. I'm a woman, I've been head chef in many kitchens, and don't think that I've never had to sneak into the walk-on fridge to cool down for two minutes because I might pass out. I have the same problems, I have the same pains. The difference is, I don't want to be taken the piss out of on an already male dominant role when I have worked so hard to overtake the next Gordon Ramsey chewing at my ankles! I am a reliable worker and I'm not about to be dropped at interviews ""just in case"" I can't give 100% every day. I HAVE spent 15 years in kitchens ""manning up"". Because whether you like it or not, the working world is NOT equal, never has been, probably never will be. And I'm happy working that bit harder than the men to prove myself. Jordan Glasspool Hewitt, Cornwall, UK
'Good idea'! Those who thought menstrual leave should be offered
I won't lie, I used to think women should just get on with it, not that we had the choice anyway. But after a miscarriage, on the first day of every period I'm crippled with constant back and pelvic pain, and mini contractions. I can barely walk it's so bad. I haven't taken time off work, but it definitely affects my work performance. Strong painkillers just leave me fatigued and confused. Now I'm more understanding. For some women, especially those with gynaecological problems, it can be debilitating. Unless someone has been in that position, they can't understand how bad it is for some women. Stacey Robertson, West Lothian, UK
There should be extra measures in place for those days. Also, some countries or companies don't offer as many sick days as others. This has nothing to do with gender equality. It's called being humane. Just because our grandmothers and mothers didn't have rights or privileges for their menstrual days, doesn't mean that we shouldn't benefit from societal advances and modern understanding!

"Simone Sorensen scored the crucial spot-kick after Austria missed their first three penalties.
The Austrians will rue wasting the best chance of the match when Sarah Puntigam fired over a first-half penalty.
Denmark also went close in normal time through Sanne Troelsgaard, whose strike came off the crossbar.
The Danes will face the hosts in the final after their 3-0 win over England in the second semi-final.
It was a tight and tense semi-final between Denmark, the two-time semi-finalists, and tournament debutants Austria.
Denmark, beaten at the last-four stage four years ago, were second best to the unfancied Austrian side during the first 45 minutes.
Dominik Thalhammer's side should have taken the lead when they were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute. Maja Kildemoes was the unlucky Dane when she was judged to have intentionally moved her arm to block Verena Aschauer's effort.
Freiburg midfielder Puntigam stepped up, but blazed her penalty over the bar.
Denmark's best effort of the opening half fell to Rosengard's Troelsgaard, whose angled left-foot strike struck the bar.
It was not until extra-time that either goal was seriously threatened again. First, Katrine Veje's effort cleared the Austria bar with a strike from eight yards. And then Pernille Harder, arguably the player of the match, headed over in the final few seconds before the spot-kicks.

She made a statement following last week's revelation that ""significant quantities"" of human remains had been found at one of the homes in Tuam.
Ms Zappone said the Tuam discovery ""confirmed what we had all feared"".
The minister also paid tribute to the ""tireless"" County Galway historian Catherine Corless, whose personal research led to the inquiry and an excavation of site.
Ms Corless found death certificates for 796 infants who died at the Tuam home from a range of natural causes when she was writing a history of the site.
She continued to ask questions about what was done with their remains when she could not locate their burial records.
An inquiry, set up in 2014, confirmed last week that human remains had been found in ""underground chambers"" on the site of the demolished home.
The minister told the DÃ¡il that for former residents, campaigners, and Ms Corless it was a ""moment of vindication"".
""After decades, and years of hard work, determination and unwavering commitment, the truth has been laid bare for all of us to see.
""This House and our entire State owe a debt of gratitude to Catherine Corless for her work.
""Many men and women alive today spent time in that institution, either as children or as young women.
""Today I offer them my personal solidarity and, as a citizen, my personal apology for the wrongs that were done to them.""
During the last century, thousands of pregnant unmarried women and girls were sent to mother-and-baby homes as it was deemed shameful to bear a child outside marriage.
Conditions in many of the institutions were harsh, and some former residents have said they felt ""incarcerated"" in the homes.
The home in Tuam, County Galway, was run by the Bon Secours order of nuns.
A child died there nearly every two weeks between the mid-1920s and 1960s.
Ms Zappone said it can ""take time to shine a light on dark periods of our history"" but added that what went on in the homes was ""not without the support of many pillars in society"".
""We must acknowledge that sometimes it was fathers and mothers, brothers and uncles, who condemned their daughters, sisters, nieces and cousins and their children to these institutions,"" the minister said.
""We must accept that between 1940 and 1965, a recorded 474 so-called ""unclaimed infant remains"" were transferred from mother-and-baby homes to medical schools in Irish universities.""
She said the plight of residents of mother and babies homes was raised in the DÃ¡il in the 1950s.
""We must acknowledge that this very House debated legislation that allowed for those residing in institutions such as county homes to work for little or nothing in return for the so-called charity that was shown to them,"" Ms Zappone said.
""Lest we contend that people did not know what was happening, let us remember that some Members of this House spoke out against it.""","The remains of 474 infants were transferred from mother-and-baby homes to medical schools over 25 years, the Irish minister for children has said.",39224107

"The latest Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.7 last month, down from January's reading of 55.6.
Any figure above 50 means expansion, but the rise in service sector activity was the weakest since March 2013.
The service sector accounts for more than three-quarters of the UK economy.
Surveys from Markit/CIPS earlier in the week put the manufacturing sector's PMI at 50.8 and construction at 54.2.
""The weaker increase in services activity mainly reflected a slower expansion in the volume of incoming new business,"" the survey said.
Markit chief economist Chris Williamson added: ""Survey responses reveal that firms are worried about signs of faltering demand, but boardrooms have also become unsettled by concerns regarding the increased risk of 'Brexit', financial market volatility and weak economic growth at home and abroad.""
He added that the extent of the slowdown would come as a ""shock"" to policymakers and would put an end to talk of a possible interest rate rise.
Mr Williamson described February's three PMI readings as ""a triple whammy of disappointing survey news"".
Last week, official figures confirmed that the UK economy grew 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, with the services sector highlighted as the key factor driving growth.
The Office for National Statistics said the ""buoyancy"" of services had offset the ""relative sluggishness"" of the rest of the UK economy.
Signs of weakening growth in the UK economy have pushed back estimates of when the Bank of England might begin to raise interest rates.
Commenting on the latest PMI survey, Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: ""The May Bank of England meeting had previously been seen as a possible time for a rate hike. The volatility of global markets and the self-inflicted wound of the EU referendum put paid to that months ago.
""We still believe, however, that some measures that foresee the Bank of England holding rates at 0.5% until 2020 are little short of absurd.""
Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the PMI readings would provide ""plenty of food for thought"" for the Bank of England's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee.
He added: ""Members will have to judge the degree to which the surveys are flagging a genuine slowdown in activity growth, or merely reacting to the negative headlines since the start of the year. In reality, growth may be softening, but perhaps not as sharply as the survey data suggest.""
Meanwhile, a similar survey indicated that eurozone businesses had their worst month for more than a year in February, bolstering the case for more monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank.
Markit's final composite PMI, which is regarded as a good guide to growth, fell to 53 last month from January's 53.6 - its lowest reading since the start of 2015.
However, that was better than the preliminary reading of 52.7 and well above the 50 mark that denotes growth.","The UK's dominant services sector weakened in February, registering its slowest rate of growth for nearly three years, a survey has indicated.",35715315
"The 10-year-old Irish-bred horse collapsed after narrowly beating Thistlecrack to win the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham's Festival Trials Day.
He was treated by veterinary staff before being pronounced dead.
The British Horseracing Authority confirmed the horse suffered from a ""severe pulmonary haemorrhage"".
Tony Welsh, acting chief veterinary officer for the BHA, said: ""Episodes such as this are rare, and can occur in horses which have no underlying health issues, and amongst all disciplines of sport horses.
""In spite of the rarity of these incidents, as a sport we are determined to do more to understand what causes these symptoms, and whether more can be done to prevent it.""
In Saturday's race, King George winner Thistlecrack caught Many Clouds close to the finish but the Trevor Hemmings-owned gelding, ridden by Leighton Aspell, fought back to win.
Many Clouds had shown symptoms of post-race ataxia in the past, which had seen him over-heat and ""wobble"" on his feet, but the horse had never collapsed before, and had shown no symptoms of post-race ataxia on Saturday.
Many Clouds had previously won the Gold Cup trial in 2015 and the Hennessy Gold Cup in 2014.
Trainer Oliver Sherwood described him as the ""horse of a lifetime"".
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
The crucial words here are ""no significant underlying health issues"".
On more than one occasion, notably after his Grand National success, Many Clouds received treatment for a tendency to 'overheat', but he soon recovered, and his welfare was closely monitored by the authorities as a result.
With that fact in mind, questions have been raised as to whether that condition was linked to his death, but this report concludes he was the victim of a haemorrhage rarely seen on the racetrack.",A post mortem examination revealed Many Clouds died from bleeding on the lung but that the 2015 Grand National winner had no underlying health problems.,38802811

"Noss Primary in Wick is closed until 30 May following what Highland Council described as a ""significant failure"" at the Â£15.4m building on Tuesday.
Gail Ross, who is the local MSP and a councillor, said it was ""a saving grace"" that pupils were having their lunch and not in the rooms at the time.
The new school only opened to pupils last month.
It was built as a replacement for Wick's North and Hillhead primary schools.
Ms Ross, who helped to unveil the name for the new school in 2014, described Tuesday's burst as ""worrying"" and ""concerning"".
She told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I spoke to the headmaster yesterday. He told me he came upon it in the corridor and its was like a sauna - a boiling hot water pipe had burst above two classrooms.
""The only saving grace was that the children were in the dining hall at the time because it doesn't bear thinking about the consequences of that if the kids had been in the classrooms.""
Highland Council said the school was closed ""due to a significant failure"" of a hot water connection to the heating system in the ceiling of the east wing of the building.

"Former Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres scored the pivotal goal on 72 minutes as Atletico moved within eight points of leaders Barcelona.
Antoine Griezmann put Atletico ahead and Denis Cheryshev equalised for Valencia before Torres struck.
Valencia had Anderlan Santos sent off on 80 minutes before Yannick Carrasco completed the scoring.
Neville suffered just a second defeat in seven games as goalkeeper Diego Alves endured a tough night.
Atletico made the brighter start so it was no real surprise when they went ahead in the 24th minute.
They squandered possession 25 yards from goal and Griezmann let fly with a low shot that crept inside the near post with home goalkeeper Alves slow to react.
The lead lasted just four minutes, however, before Valencia scored as a long pass was cushioned by the head of Paco Alcacer to Cheryshev, who lashed home a left-footed drive from 15 yards.
Cheryshev lifted a shot over the crossbar from another Alcacer header seven minutes before half-time as Valencia grew in confidence.
Alcacer had a chance to put Valencia ahead just before the hour mark when he latched onto a pass by Sofiane Feghouli but fired straight at goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
Moments later Alves made up for his earlier error with a fantastic, one-handed save to keep out a powerful effort by Luciano Vietto.
But the keeper could do nothing to stop substitute Torres, who was making his 300th Atletico appearance, putting his side ahead with 18 minutes remaining as he slid in at the far post to turn the ball home after Jose Maria Gimenez flicked on a corner.
Santos saw red for two bookable offences with five minutes remaining and Carrasco made it 3-1 five minutes later when he fired straight at Alves, who allowed the ball to creep in under his legs.

Rogers needed 14 stitches in his lip after a challenge by Tyrone's Tiernan McCann at the start of the game.
""I think Brendan was quite shocked. Some people were quite horrified,"" said the Derry manager.
""I'll leave it to other people to make up their minds.""
The Slaughtneil man had the stitches inserted last Sunday and Barton expects Rogers to be out of action for a couple of more weeks.
Rogers was named at midfield for the McKenna Cup final and the match video suggested he may have been caught by McCann's right elbow immediately after challenging for the initial throw-in.
After the ball was thrown in, McCann came in from the side and the footage showed the Tyrone man clattering into Rogers although the Red Hand county player appeared to be focusing on the ball rather than the Derry midfielder when the contact was made.

""I think the amount of respect that was shown between Derry and Tyrone was very evident but it's one of those things I'll let people make up their own minds about.""
In terms of Sunday's opening league win, Barton felt that his team had laboured badly in the first half before going on to clinch a nine-point victory over the Erne County.
""We were very flat at the start of the game. We turned over a serious amount of ball under no pressure.
""I was glad to see our first goal going in (before half-time) and I was very happy to see half-time because it gave us an opportunity to restructure and talk about what we felt we were going wrong.

""I feel sad about it as it was another good opportunity for me to represent my country,"" Omeruo told BBC Sport.
""The doctor insists I need rest to start next season without injury.""
Omeruo was first called up by Nigeria in January 2013 and he went on to play at that year's Africa Cup of Nations and Confederations Cup - and at the 2014 World Cup.
He admitted he was looking forward to playing at the Games, especially after the Super Eagles' failure to qualify for the 2015 and 2017 African Cup of Nations.
""It is disappointing and frustrating to say the least. I'd be lying if I said I would not want to be out there playing,"" he said.

"In a statement, the company said the move will hit next year's profit by about £15m.
In addition, if the pound averages $1.20 over the financial year, it may lose another £20m.
Overnight on Friday the pound temporarily plunged by 6%, in a flash crash that is thought to have been triggered by automated trading.
Shares in Sports Direct closed down 9% on Friday.
The company had expected to report underlying profit of £300m based on the pound trading at $1.30 against the dollar.
However, the retailer said that ""extreme movements overnight"" would result ""in a negative impact of approximately £15m"" on its results for the current financial year.
The swings overnight hit the company's hedging arrangements, which are designed to protect a business against volatile currency prices.
It also sustained a large loss in its last financial year because of currency movements.
In that case, because of a fall in the value of the pound against the euro, it took a £65m hit.
As a result, Sports Direct reported underlying earnings of £381.4m for the year to 24 April against expectations of £420m, resulting in staff missing out on a bonus.

From the time the new rule comes in to place, incidents such as Mario Balotelli's infamous ""Why Always Me?"" message, which he revealed after scoring against Manchester United in 2011, will be banned and subject to a sanction.
Fifa general secretary Jerome Valcke said: ""It is definitely decided that players must not have any slogan or statement, and we are making the decision that it will apply to the World Cup.""

It states: ""Players must not reveal undergarments that show political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturer logo.
""A player/team of a player that reveals an undergarment that shows political, religious, personal slogans, statements or images, or advertising other than the manufacturers' logo will be sanctioned by the competition organiser or by Fifa.""
Meanwhile, the IFAB rejected a proposal from Uefa to amend the so-called ""triple punishment"" which occurs when a penalty kick is given within a game, warranting a player being sent off and a possible goal being scored.

"He said he still favoured the use of Sterling, but said the independence case needs ""refurbishment"".
The MP believed a better case for the retention of the pound would prevent the independence case being ""gazumped"" by opponents in a future referendum.
Had Scotland voted ""Yes"", the planned independence day would have been 24 March.
When asked by BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell about the pro-independence camp's stance on currency, Mr Salmond said: ""I think the argument you have got to put forward is one which can withstand any position adopted by your opponents.
""So, you mustn't allow yourself to be gazumped by your opponents.
""Now, I think sterling is the right currency for Scotland, because of a whole range of reasons that we gave during the campaign.""
The former SNP leader was speaking a matter of weeks after current leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced plans for a fresh campaign for independence.
She told her party's spring conference in Glasgow, that she would hear ""concerns"" and ""address questions"".
In September 2014, voters north of the border decided by 55% to 45% to stay part of the United Kingdom.
The SNP's new strategy will begin in the summer, after May's Holyrood election and June's EU referendum.
Ms Sturgeon said the party was prepared to challenge some of the answers it gave 18 months ago.
Reacting to Mr Salmond's comments, Scottish Labour's Iain Gray said: ""As far as I can make out he seems to be arguing again for Sterlingisation, a proposal that would have meant Scotland would have become an independent country and at that very moment given up control over its currency and much of its fiscal policy.
""That didn't make sense in 2014, the majority of the Scottish public didn't think it made sense, and it still doesn't make sense now.""
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond had ""a bit of a cheek"" in ""acknowledging 18 months after the fact that his currency case was always flawed"".
She said: ""People in Scotland have been well served by the pound as part of the UK, particularly with all the shocks and instability we've seen over the last few years in the world economy.
""If there is a united push from the SNP to get us back to yet another referendum, I'll be standing full square behind the decision that we as a country made to stay part of the UK.""
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said it was time to move on from the whole matter to focus on the ""big challenges"".
He added: ""There's no doubt that currency was one of the weakest arguments during the referendum. But the SNP need to move on - we all need to move on from the last five years. It was dominated by independence.
""If we keep dragging over the coals from yesterday's argument, we'll never sort out the future.""
Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""welcome"" and ""probably almost inevitable"" that the SNP would re-evaluate its position on the pound.
He went on: ""That idea of a currency union failed to convince us, because Scotland would have been in a situation where it didn't have the freedom to set its own economic policy. There were a great many Yes voters who were not sold on that notion of a currency union.
""It's inevitable that there were many people who might ultimately have been persuaded to vote yes, who voted no, and one of the reasons was the lack of clarity on currency.""",Former first minister Alex Salmond has called for a fresh look at the currency options for an independent Scotland.,35887257

In the letter, seen by BBC Look North, Ms Thompson said: ""I just feel like I don't want to be here no more.""

A post-mortem examination found the cause of Ms Thompson's death was thought to be hanging.

"Former Milan station chief Robert Lady had been released and had boarded a US-bound flight, said American officials.
Lady was sentenced to nine years in jail for his involvement in the 2003 abduction of the man - an Egyptian cleric - in Milan.
The cleric, known as Abu Omar, was allegedly flown to Egypt and tortured.
In 2009, Lady was convicted in absentia with 22 other Americans for their role in his ""extraordinary rendition"".
He was reportedly arrested on Wednesday near Panama's border with Costa Rica.
According to Italian media reports, an international search warrant for Lady was sought by the justice minister in Italy's previous government in December 2012.
The Milan trial was the first involving extraordinary rendition, the CIA's practice of transferring suspects to countries where torture is permitted.
The practice has been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of international agreements.
Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was considered a terrorism suspect by the US.
He was abducted on a Milan street in February 2003 and transferred between US military bases in Italy and Germany before being brought to Egypt.
Twenty-two CIA agents, including Lady and an air force pilot, were convicted in 2009 of abducting the cleric. Their sentences were upheld last year by Italy's highest appeals court.
Three more Americans, including CIA Rome station chief Jeffrey Castelli, were convicted by an appeals court in February.
None of the 26 convicted has ever appeared in an Italian court, and only two have had any contact with their lawyers.

"A ruling will allow users and expert analysts to carry out repairs. But changes such as extracting and selling code would still breach copyright.
Vehicle manufacturers opposed the move, saying repair garages could fix any issues.
The ruling follows claims the right to modify software could have prevented the Volkswagen emissions scandal.
The Library of Congress, which oversees the US Copyright Office, agreed with fair use advocates who argued that vehicle owners are entitled to modify their cars, which often involves altering software, Reuters reported.
Manufacturers, including General Motors (GM) and Deere, spoke out in opposition. A GM representative referred to a statement from an industry group that said the new rules would weaken safety innovation.
""Sensitive vehicle data could be easily manipulated, altered, or distributed - undetected - if these changes are implemented,"" the statement said.
Deere spokesman Ken Golden said the company stands by its earlier opposition. But he added that some systems that transmit data from the vehicle to Deere could still be protected by copyright.
Security researchers also pushed for copyright liability protection because computer programs are ""pervasive"" in modern machines and devices, including vehicles, home appliances and medical devices.
""We are pleased that analysts will now be able to examine the software in the cars we drive without facing legal threats from car manufacturers,"" said Kit Walsh, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which advocated for the rule changes.

The RCN welcomed the promise but said it would only work if backed up with funding for extra staff.
The first minister will tell the congress that the planned legislation will reinforce patient safety.
She is expected to say: ""Since this government came to power in 2007 there are more than 2,300 extra qualified nurses and midwives working in our NHS.
""In addition to having record staffing levels, Scotland has led the UK in the development of mandatory nursing and midwifery workload and workforce planning tools that help health boards to plan for the number of staff they require.
""By using these tools, health boards can make sure they have the right number of staff to provide the best possible care for patients in a variety of specialities.
""To build on our record, we will enshrine these planning tools in law and examine what other areas of the workforce would benefit from having similar tools developed, which will further strengthen our commitment to patient safety in our wards.""
Chief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen added: ""The link between safe and sustainable staffing levels - including qualified nurse numbers - and high quality care is well established.
""It's vital to have the right number of staff in place, with the right skills. We already have building blocks in place in Scotland to achieve this, including evidence-based planning tools and enhanced training.""
Theresa Fyffe, president of RCN Scotland, said the statutory staffing requirement would be welcome if it was backed up with funding.
She said: ""The challenge is going to be the financial pressures we are under right now.
""So having mandated staffing levels will be good but if there isn't the finance to pay for the staffing, you end with the pressure being felt back at the (health) boards and it doesn't really resolve the problem.""

""Everyone knows the affiliation I have with the club,"" said Pearson. ""I thoroughly enjoyed my time here.
""It is a good place to come and work so it ticked all the boxes for me and hopefully it suits Motherwell in the short term.""
Pearson returns to Scotland with an Indian Super League winner's medal and plenty of fond memories.
""It was very good. I went out and did pre-season in Madrid for a month and then we flew for the season beginning in October and finished the season off just before Christmas,"" he said.
""We managed to win the league, which was great.
""So it made up for the big decision to go out there in the first place, it kind of justified that by coming back with a winner's medal.""
The Indian Super League has only been around for a few years, with the short season and long distance travel notable elements of the experience for Pearson.
""This will only be the fourth year [of the Indian Super League] coming up now, so it is still in the early stages. It is a good competition, only over a short period of time, so the games are thick and fast with lots of travelling - that is one of the things I found quite difficult, the travelling side of it.
""But I could not speak highly enough of the league. Everybody out there is superb. They try to be as professional as possible. They have got a lot of experience and big names out there and they are trying to build up grass-roots level and start from the bottom.""
Pearson also believes the lure of lucrative contracts in India will encourage other players to try their luck over in the sub-continent.
He said: ""It is certainly a place you will see a lot of players trying to get to. There is a lot of money there, especially for the foreign players who come in. You're allowed 15 foreign players, and 15 local players. But you can only have five foreign players in the starting team at one time - I think they might be reducing that to encourage the progression of the Indian lads.""
However, Pearson says Indian football still cannot compete with the money being splashed by clubs in China.
""I think the money that is getting thrown around in China is just on another level at the minute,"" he said.
""In India they do try to pay the foreign players well because it is only a short time that they are out there and they want to get the best players to come and help the Indian players develop.
""They are passionate about it and everything they do, they give it their all.""
In terms of his ambitions with Motherwell for the rest of the Premiership season, Pearson added: ""I am just looking forward to helping the team out, contribute as much as I can between now and the end of the season and help this club finish as high up the league as possible.""",Motherwell have signed Stephen Pearson until the end of the season - the midfielder's third spell at the club.,38842342

The striker has scored 12 goals for City, but they are bottom of their Champions League group and six points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea.
""Of course we understand the people who have been criticising us,"" 26-year-old Aguero told Football Focus.
""The club invests in top players and the fans want to see more from us.""
Aguero added: ""But we still have time to put things right. The supporters here are more respectful and patient but they still expect a bit more from all of us. We can still turn it around, though.""
The Argentina international scored the winner as City began the week by winning 1-0 in a tumultuous Manchester derby.
But on Wednesday, they were booed off the field after losing 2-1 at home to Russian side CSKA Moscow.
City's Champions League record since they first played in the competition in 2011 is played 24, won eight, drawn six, lost 10. They have not kept a clean sheet in nine home games.
Manuel Pellegrini's team could go out even if they win their next two games against Roma and Bayern Munich.
""In the Champions League, we are not currently in the position we want to be,"" said Aguero.  ""It's not what we were expecting. The only thing we can do is to keep going, we still have two games to play and we have to win both, and then wait and see how the other results go.
""In spite of how badly things have gone in the Champions League, we are still fortunate enough to be able to qualify. So it's up to us.""","Sergio Aguero says he can understand why Manchester City have been criticised this season, but expects their form to quickly improve.",29958922
"And if they were all forced to pick just one with which to tell the story of the Obama presidency, many would plump for the bar chart of ""non-farm payrolls"".
The non-farm payrolls report is simply the official measure of how many jobs the US economy has added (or lost) in the previous month.
The release of this job tally, which happens at the same time, on the same day (the first Friday) of every single month, is one of the constants in the working life of a Wall Street economist or reporter.
Many feel they measure out their lives with non-farm payroll reports.
But you can reasonably measure out the Obama presidency with them as well.
Take a look at the chart.
On it you can see that from the first such report after entering the White House, President Obama learned that the US economy had just shed 800,000 jobs in one month.
No other figure so clearly illustrates that Mr Obama started his presidency with an economy that wasn't just weak, it was on the verge of collapse.
A recession of a severity not seen since the 1930s was under way.
The most pressing question for the new president was what, if anything, could be done to stabilise the economy so that it could create jobs once more.
The chart shows us what happened.
By early 2010 the monthly tally shows the US was adding jobs again
And albeit with further dips later that year, it has done so ever since.
The last non-farm payrolls report of the Obama era showed that in December 2016 the US economy added 156,000 jobs.
It was also the 75th consecutive month of job growth.
There has never been such a long period of job creation.
The official unemployment rate in the US is now 4.7%. For many economists that represents ""full employment"".
But the chart doesn't tell us WHY the job market bottomed out and started its long expansion.
For an explanation of that you might start with one word: Detroit
Detroit, or rather the US car industry with which the city is synonymous, was seemingly in its death throes in January 2009.
The recession and financial crisis had hit General Motors, Chrysler and Ford particularly hard.
Already heavily indebted, by the turn of the Obama administration it looked like they would simply run out of cash and cease operations within weeks.
President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler with bridging loans and managed bankruptcies (Ford managed to turn itself around without government money) was deeply controversial.
But look again at the chart.
If the auto industry had in fact collapsed, we would probably need to spread something like a million more job losses across those bars for 2009-10.
Beyond the number of jobs directly or indirectly lost, it's hard to calculate the ultimate economic effects of a disintegration of the US auto industry.
But it seems safe to say that America would look very different indeed without the auto bailout.
There was also Mr Obama's stimulus package - or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to give it its official name.
This was a package of government spending which Congress passed, at the new president's behest, within weeks of his taking office.
It too met fierce criticism and its impact has long been disputed.
Still, more than one analysis has estimated that through 2010 it created or saved more than 2 million jobs.
Taking those away would also dramatically alter the non-farm payrolls chart.
At least it would for the beginning of Mr Obama's presidency.
But after the first two years of his administration the politics of job creation, like everything else, changed.
The Republican Party's capture of the House of Representatives in November 2010 deprived the president of most of his influence on the writing of new laws.
He lost his grasp of one of the main levers of economic control and never regained it.
That means that so much of the long period of job growth, from 2011 to the present, has unfolded with little input from the White House.
Of course the president always has large powers, whoever controls Congress, but they tend to be in the administration of business regulations and in trade relations.
Attributing the creation of jobs to those functions of government is even more speculative than attributing them to new laws.
Still, if presidents cannot write laws, their veto power means laws can hardly ever be passed without them.
It is a feature of the notorious political ""gridlock"" that has characterised much of the Obama era.
The president and the Republican Congress have been in a perpetual stand-off over so many issues at the heart of the economy.
The result is that many economic problems have gone unaddressed.
Yet it also means that politicians, and their insistence on change and reform, have been kept on the sidelines, leaving the economy to develop without them.
In the absence of major external shocks, perhaps the consistent job growth the US has enjoyed for more than six years should be attributed, not to the name and the politics of the president but to things more fundamental to the US and its brand of capitalism.
It seems appropriate that after the steep steps down, then up, in the first 18 months of the non-farm payrolls bar chart, what the Obama presidency looks like is then a consistent series of bars, representing steady if undramatic job growth, month after month after month.",Economists and economics reporters do like their charts and graphs.,38581768
"The Waking the Dragon tower was granted permission by Wrexham council back in February 2011.
Businessman Simon Wingett is trying to raise £2.5m to build the bronze sculpture, cultural centre and gardens at Chirk Park.
Councillors are expected to grant the extension at a meeting on Tuesday.
The 23.5m (77ft)-high dragon with wings spanning 57m (187ft) would stand on top of a 41.5m (147ft) tower at the former colliery site.
Mr Wingett has said the sculpture will rival other well-known landmarks such as the Angel of the North, but time is running out on planning permission for the project granted back in 2011.
He hopes to raise £1m for the visitor attraction from the public, with the rest of the cash raised through loans from Finance Wales and grants from the Welsh Government.

"Entries for all candidates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are down 0.7% on last year to 5,240,796, according to official figures.
By contrast, in England the overall entry for GCSEs in England increased slightly from 4,916,000 in 2015 to 4,929,000 this year.
Early entries (for students in Year 10 or below) fell for the second year running in England to 300,000 - a 13% drop on 2015.
This follows a 32% fall from 504,000 in 2014 to 344,000 in 2015 and reflects government moves to discourage schools from entering pupils early.
But more older students were entered this year, reflecting the raising of the participation age in education to 17 in 2013 and then to 18 last year.
The government is also encouraging older pupils to resit English and maths if they do not achieve good grades (A* to C) in Year 11
This year there were 355,000 GCSE entries for post-Year 11 students, up 26% on last year's figure of 282,000.
By subject, Ofqual noted 2016 increases for Year 11 students in English literature, biology, chemistry, physics, geography, history, science, additional science Spanish and computing.
But entries fell in English and English language, German and French.
In England this year's GCSEs will be the last to be marked under the existing system, graded A* to G.
Last September new ""more demanding"" courses were introduced in English and maths for the current Year 10 - but this change will not have any affect on this year's results as the new courses are linear and will be examined next summer at the end of two years.
In England students who started GCSE courses last September in maths, English and English literature will be graded 1-9 in these subjects when they get their results in summer 2017.
The new grades will come in for most other GCSEs the following year.
These include biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, languages, religious education, geography, music and history, which will be taught from September 2016, with exams in 2018.
A third wave of 1-9 graded GCSEs will be taught from September 2017 with exams in 2019.
These include psychology, ancient history, business, information and communications technology (ICT) and media studies.
Ofqual has also said that it expects broadly the same proportion of students who currently received a grade C and above under the current system to achieve a grade 4 and above under the new system.
The new courses will include far less coursework, with grades in almost all subjects depending on exams. These courses are designed to be more rigorous with exams taken after two years of study rather than in modules with exams along the way.
Foundation and higher-tier papers for students in different ability ranges will be phased out.
A GCSE reform programme is also under way in Wales with new courses from the WJEC board taught in Welsh schools from last September in six key subjects.
These are English language, Welsh language, English literature, Welsh literature, mathematics and numeracy and mathematics.
The November 2017 and summer 2017 exams will reflect these new qualifications and the results will no longer be comparable with their equivalents in England, says the Welsh government.
Northern Ireland is also developing new GCSE specifications for first teaching from September 2017 and will retain A*-G grades rather than adopt England's new numeric grading system.
Some schools offer courses from English exam boards alongside those from the Northern Ireland board, CCEA.
You may get your results by text, email or in the post, but it's still a good idea to go to your school or college on results day. By doing this, you can get help and advice from your teachers.
If you live in England, yes. This summer's GCSE cohort in England (born between 1 September 1999 and 31 August 2000) is the second to have to stay in education or employment with training until 18.
In Scotland, if you turn 16 between 1 March and 30 September, you can leave school after 31 May of that year. If you turn 16 between 1 October and the end of February, you can leave at the start of the Christmas holidays in that school year.
In Wales, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as you will be 16 by the end of that school year's summer holidays.
In Northern Ireland, if you turn 16 during the school year (between 1 September and 1 July), you can leave school after 30 June. If you turn 16 between 2 July and 31 August, you cannot leave school until 30 June the following year.
Try not to panic. If you don't get the grades asked for by the sixth-form or college of your choice, approach the staff there and see if they are prepared to be flexible. It's possible they will still give you a place or they might be prepared to take you on for different courses. Alternatively, approach other schools or colleges - you might find they will accept you.
Resits will be complicated by the course changes, with the current set of GCSEs in English and maths being phased out. Ofqual has required the boards to offer resits in the current English, English and maths exams in November and next summer and in science subjects no later than summer 2018.
For other current GCSE courses, boards will also be allowed to offer a single resit opportunity in the year following the last scheduled sitting.
Students will have to resit all the exams for the qualification and there is an expectation that candidates will be at least 16.
If you feel strongly that your grades are wrong and do not reflect your ability, you can ask for a re-mark of your papers. Requests for re-marking can only be done through your school or college. Make sure someone there is dealing with the matter. There is a fee for this service, which is reimbursed only if there is a grade change.

"It was written to author Betty Shew by the 21-year-old princess in 1947, months before her marriage.

The 34-year-old, who won 10,000m gold eight days ago, was swamped by his rivals in the final lap and Ethiopia's Muktar Edris broke clear to win gold.
Britain's Farah kicked again to take silver at the London Stadium in his final major track championships.
Britain's men won a stunning 4x100m relay gold as the women took silver.
""It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,"" Farah told BBC Sport.
""It didn't quite hit home until after I crossed the line and had a couple of moments to myself when I realised - this is it.
""I gave it all - I didn't have a single bit left at the end.""
Four-time Olympic champion Farah will finish his track career with a record of 10 golds and two silvers in major championships.
He is set to focus on marathons after his final track appearance at the 5,000m Diamond League final in Zurich on 24 August.
Gold and silver in the two 4x100m relays takes Britain's medal tally at London 2017 to four - Farah supplying the other two - but the hosts are still two short of UK Sport's target of six to eight.
Edris, 23, ran a superbly judged final 600m to claim his first major title with a sprint finish reminiscent of so many Farah triumphs.
After a brief burst from Farah's compatriot Andrew Butchart at the front of the race, the Ethiopian trio of Edris, Yomif Kejelcha and Selemon Barega moved up to box in the home favourite.
Barega fell back but Edris used Kejelcha as a pace-setter into the home straight before surging away while Farah battled for position with the resurgent Paul Chelimo behind.
Farah finally found open track but Edris was gone, with the Briton passing the fading Kejelcha and holding off Chelimo to salvage silver.
""The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I realised,"" said Farah.
""I was trying to cover every move but they had a game plan - one of them was going to sacrifice himself and that's what they did and the better man won.""
Farah has now lost just two of his 22 5,000m contests since 2011.
""I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,"" said Edris, who won in a time of 13 minutes 32.79 seconds to claim his first win over the Briton in five attempts.
""I am the new champion for Ethiopia, that's why I did the 'Mobot' [Farah's traditional celebration] - I am the next champion.""
1976 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist and BBC commentator Brendan Foster: ""We did say fatigue was going to get him. It has to come to an end. He hates losing.""
BBC athletics expert Allison Curbishley: ""In my head and my heart I didn't think anyone could genuinely beat Mo Farah but that 10,000m at the start of the week took so much out of him. Edris, we take our hat off to you. This man has beaten the legend that is Mo Farah in his own back yard.""
2005 marathon world champion Paul Radcliffe: ""He just doesn't have the pace in his legs anymore to be able to live with challengers like that but this isn't the end of Mo Farah in athletics. He has a new challenge ahead of him in the marathon.""
Two-time Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson: ""He has got to be hurting. But it has to end for everybody. In a couple of weeks or months, he will look back and say, 'that was awesome'.""
2004 Olympic 4x100m relay champion Darren Campbell: ""There are athletes out there who have won more medals, but the quality of those medals and for Mo to have led an event on his own... wow. I don't know how you can't see him as our greatest ever athlete.""

A disconsolate Farah dropped to the track as Edris mimicked his famous celebration, before finally picking himself up to complete a farewell lap.
Farah has come under scrutiny in recent years, with his coach Alberto Salazar under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.
The Briton also recently denied any wrongdoing after computer hackers revealed some of his blood samples had initially been flagged as suspicious, before later being declared normal.
After initial shock at the result, the crowd found their voice to give Farah a final warm send-off at the stadium he lit up with double Olympic gold in 2012.
""Back in 2008 at the Olympics I was so disappointed [at not making the 5,000m final] and I didn't know what to do with myself, whether to carry on with the sport,"" said Farah.
""I had to decide what it took to become a champion and that was to move to the other side of the world - nothing was guaranteed but I took that chance.
""This London crowd is amazing - there is no place like home.
""I have a few more races on the track, then I will take a short break and then this chapter of my life is closed.""
Elsewhere, Britons Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake finished fifth and sixth respectively in the high jump as Maria Lasitskene - the Russian competing as a neutral athlete - won gold with a leap of 2.03m.
And Ashley Bryant finished 11th in the men's decathlon, with Kevin Mayer becoming the first French world champion in the event.

At 44 years old, Owens was the oldest of the 12 referees chosen for the World Cup, but his age will not prevent him from taking part in Japan in 2019.
Selection criteria is based on performances and fitness, and Owens feels he has plenty more years in him.
""My plans at the moment are quite clearly to go on until 2019,"" he said.
""We had a meeting with the assessors and I was asked what my plans were and I said 'I'm enjoying my refereeing and as long as I keep reffing well and I'm fit enough I want to go on to 2019'.
""Their response was 'great, we're glad to hear that, we'd like you to be there in 2019'.""
Saturday's World Cup final at Twickenham, which New Zealand won 34-17 against Australia, was the pinnacle of Owens' 68-Test career.
He became the second Welshman to oversee the final following Derek Bevan, who was in charge in 1991 when Australia edged England, also at Twickenham.
South African Andre Watson is the only referee to be in charge of two finals.
He was 45 on his second appearance in the 2003 final, won by England against hosts Australia.
World Rugby, the game's governing body, has welcomed Owens' decision to prolong his international career, adding he had shown exceptional fitness standards during the recent tournament.
Owens admits the pressure, scrutiny and physical demands on referees are higher than ever, but he insists the passion for the job remains.
""I just thoroughly enjoy it and I'm going to keep on doing it as long as I can and as long as I'm good at it,"" he said.
""When the time is right and I know the body or the mind can't take it any more because of the travelling or the pressure, or when the legs can't get there to make those big decisions, then I'll know that and I will be calling it a day when that happens.""
Sections of the Australian media have criticised aspects of Owens' performance in the final, claiming he missed a forward pass in the passage of play that ended with Dan Carter kicking a penalty to stretch New Zealand's advantage to 9-3.
Owens, though, says he has learned to deal with criticism, and feels his decisions on Saturday did not affect the eventual outcome.
""If you can't deal with criticism as a referee you just can't do this job,"" he said.
""There's something in you that helps you deal with that.
""It doesn't make it any nicer for me to hear criticism, especially if any criticism is personal.
""As long as you can look back on a game and say 'I did my best, I gave it my all' that's what counts.""
Owens revealed he was hugged and thanked for a ""great game"" by Australia number eight David Pocock moments after the final whistle.
""For someone who's just missed out on winning the Webb Ellis Trophy to come up and do that to you says a lot about the integrity of the man himself and what a wonderful sport rugby is,"" added Owens.
The Welsh village of Gowerton will be Owens' next destination for a Swalec League Division One West match with Crymych.
Two weeks later, he will be in the south of France for Toulon's European Champions Cup tie with Bath.
""I could've had a weekend off this weekend - a couple of refs have taken a couple of weekends off,"" said Owens.
""But I'd rather be out there reffing, whether it's under-12s, a schools game, youth game, a Division One West game or a World Cup final.""",World Cup final referee Nigel Owens says he intends to keep officiating in international rugby for another four years.,34708101

At the end of a mammoth one-hour press conference following his suspension from football for eight years, Blatter echoed Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous catchphrase from the Terminator film franchise, suggesting he is not done yet.
With Blatter, 79, also sporting a plaster on his face in the style of US rapper Nelly and claiming to be Fifa's ""punching ball"", it was surreal and quotable affair as he denied any wrongdoing in four languages.
The Swiss has never been shy to air his views during his 17-year stint as president - BBC Sport looks back at some of his most notable comments.
""To say that today is a good day for me or for Fifa, this would be totally wrong.
""I am really sorry. I am sorry that I am still a punching ball. I am as president of Fifa this punching ball. And I am sorry for football. I am sorry to Fifa.
""I have never lost my mind.
""I'm not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in French: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I'm not a fool].
""What was wrong with me is at the end of the World Cup in Brazil I should have stopped.""
""Fifa is still working well.""
Highlights from Blatter's news conference after Fifa's ethics committee handed him and Uefa boss Michel Platini eight-year bans from football, December 2015.
""I am the president now, the president of everybody.
""I take the responsibility to bring back Fifa where it should be... Let's go Fifa! Let's go Fifa!
""At the end of my term I will give up Fifa in a strong position.""
Blatter proves to be far from psychic about the end of his reign, speaking after he won won a fifth term as president,May 2015.
""Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts.
""Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men - such as playing with a lighter ball.
""That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?""

""I could understand it if it had happened in Africa, but not in Italy.""
Blatter, speaking to La Gazzetta dello Sport in March 2006 as a match-fixing scandal came to light in Italy's top two divisions.
""Listen, this is a special approach in the Anglo-Saxon countries. If this had happened in, let's say, Latin countries then I think he would have been applauded.""
Blatter says John Terry should not have been sacked as England captain amid allegations - subsequently revealed to be untrue - of an extramarital affair, February 2010.
""I'd say they should refrain from any sexual activities.""
Blatter if he foresaw any problems for gay fans travelling to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where homosexuality is illegal, December 2010.
""There is no racism [on the field], but maybe there is a word or gesture that is not correct.
""The one affected by this should say 'this is a game' and shake hands.""
Blatter after the Football Association charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez with racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League game. The Fifa president later said his comments had been misunderstood, November 2011.
""Say something, ladies. You are always speaking at home, now you can speak here.""
Blatter addresses the Fifa Congress in Mauritius as the first woman is appointed to its executive committee, May 2013.
""They want to get rid of me. All this opposition is coming now, it's unfortunate to say it. It's coming from Nyon, from Uefa. They don't have the courage to come in. So let me go [on] -- be respectful!""
Blatter says he believes Uefa is behind a campaign to remove him from the presidency, January 2015.

Mr Davies was shot after firing a gun from the house. The inquest continues.

Giving evidence at the hearing, Mrs Davies said she had initially believed her husband had ""some acceptance"" about the end of their relationship and said ""there wasn't an ounce of anger"" during their conversation earlier that day.
However, he had made several trips to a nearby shop to buy alcohol and had been carrying a knife, the inquest heard.
Mrs Davies went to visit her sister and when her children returned to the family home their father tied them up.
The inquest then heard how the children managed to make 999 calls and alert their mother.
She received a text that read: ""Call the police. Get them to come to our house. Dad's going to kill himself. He's tied us up. I'm not joking.""
When Mrs Davies arrived, one child had managed to escape.
She said when Mr Davies came to the door ""he didn't really look like my husband"".

"The Port of Grangemouth container terminal is being resurfaced under a Â£1.5m investment programme by owners Forth Ports.
The project will create additional storage lanes for laden containers and improve equipment access to landside and shipside operations.
Forth Ports said the surface upgrade would increase the terminal's total capacity to 12,000 containers.
That represents a 50% increase since 2005.
The work is expected to be completed in October.
A feasibility study has also been launched on deepening the port's shipping channel to enable it to handle larger, heavier container ships and bulk vessels.
Both projects are being undertaken in response to changes in the container shipping market, where there is a trend towards larger capacity vessels which require deeper water.
Forth Ports group chief executive Charles Hammond said: ""This is an important investment for the business which will further secure Grangemouth's position as Scotland's largest container terminal.
""We have analysed the shipping trends and identified the growing demand to accommodate larger vessels from around the world.

"LGBT Youth Scotland said its research suggested more needed to be done to ensure LGBT young people felt safe.
It urged those affected to understand their rights and report discrimination.
The charity said not every young person was aware of what constituted a criminal act under hate crime legislation .
In an online survey of LGBT people aged 13 to 25 conducted by the charity, 49% of the 273 respondents said they felt safe and supported by the legal system. The figure fell to 40% among those who identified as transgender.
Half of those surveyed said they were aware of their rights, while a similar proportion (53%) said they would feel confident in reporting a crime they experienced to the police.
Among transgender young people the figure dropped to 48%, while bisexual women were the least likely to feel confident reporting a hate crime at 46%.
Just over half (51%) of transgender young people said they felt safe using public transport.
While the charity has welcomed an increase in the reporting of hate crimes, YGBT Youth Scotland has recommended that campaigns, activities and lesson plans be developed for use in schools, with specific reference to hate crime.
Chief executive Fergus McMillan said: ""In Scotland, we are fortunate to have strong hate crime legislation that is inclusive of transgender identities yet the safety report shows a gap in knowledge and confidence for transgender young people in particular.
""When young people know about their rights, and have confidence in the process, they are more likely to be willing to report.
""An increase in reported crimes since the introduction of the legislation is certainly positive, yet more must be done to ensure that LGBT young people feel safe in their communities, understand their rights and how to report discrimination and harassment, and have the confidence to report.""","Many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT) young people still encounter harassment in public spaces, according to a Scottish charity.",33103763

"The company insists it is still committed to launching the smart glasses as a consumer product, but will stop producing Glass in its present form.
Instead it will focus on ""future versions of Glass"" with work carried out by a different division to before.
The Explorer programme, which gave software developers the chance to buy Glass for $1,500 (Â£990) will close.
The programme was launched in the United States in 2013. It was then opened up to anyone and was launched in the UK last summer.
It had been expected that it would be followed reasonably quickly by a full consumer launch.
From next week, the search firm will stop taking orders for the product but it says it will continue to support companies that are using Glass.
The Glass team will also move out of the Google X division which engages in ""blue sky"" research, and become a separate undertaking, under its current manager Ivy Ross.
She and the Glass team will report to Tony Fadell, the chief executive of the home automation business Nest, acquired by Google a year ago.
He said the project had ""broken ground and allowed us to learn what's important to consumers and enterprises alike"" and he was excited to be working with the team ""to integrate those learnings into future products"".
Google says it is committed to working on the future of the product, but gave no timescale for the launch of any new version.
The Glass project received the enthusiastic backing of Google's co-founder Sergey Brin. He presided over a spectacular unveiling which saw skydivers jump out of an aircraft wearing Glass and beam what they were seeing to a conference in San Francisco.
Early users of Glass were very excited about the product, which enabled them get information in a small screen above their right eye, take photos and videos, and get directions. The technology blogger Robert Scoble said he could not now imagine living a day without the product, and was even photographed wearing it in the shower.
But he and others soon tired of Glass, complaining that it was not evolving in the ways that had been promised. There were also concerns about privacy and safety, with some bars and restaurants banning the use of the smart glasses on their premises.
Other companies have launched smart glasses and various other forms of wearable technology. But no single product has yet proved the major hit that technology companies are looking for as they seek out the next big thing.
Google has tried to present this announcement as just another step in the evolution of an amazing innovation. But make no mistake - Google Glass is dead, at least in its present form.
As I found when I spent a couple of months wearing Glass, it has a number of really useful aspects - in particular the camera. There is however one huge disadvantage - it makes its users look daft, and that meant that it was never going to appeal to a wide audience.
But Google will now have to deal with a disgruntled community of Explorers who paid a large sum for a device which they must have believed would eventually evolve into something more useful.
The Glass team can at least continue its work out of the spotlight without the pressure of deadlines. Tony Fadell, the former Apple designer Google acquired with his smart thermostat firm Nest, will oversee the future of the product.

"The warning comes as the Scottish curry industry will celebrate its annual awards ceremony in Glasgow on Monday.
The rules prevent non-EU chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service.
The UK government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine.
But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs.
The rules, laid down by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) and the Home Office, are part of the Tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the Shortage Occupation List.
They must be paid at least Â£29,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or ""standard fare"" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service.
But Ajmal Mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in Hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was ""total insanity"".
Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: ""Here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes.
""What the government are saying is: if I put that same dish into a container, I'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from India.
""The quality is the exact same.""
Mr Mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold.
He currently employs three Indian-born chefs who have been in Scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing.
""As a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, I have been able to create 52 jobs in this business,"" he said.
""We are at the point of expanding our business. If I were to bring over another two chefs, I would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone.""
The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the Brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the EU.
International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who campaigned for a Leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a ""travesty"" that curry houses were subjected to a ""second class UK immigration system"" in comparison to EU chefs.
With a growth in online apps such as Hungry House and Just Eat promoting home delivery of food, Hans Ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency Goldstar Chefs, said the government approach to the Indian restaurant sector was wrong.
""They have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not,"" he said.
""The biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity.
""It is affecting the product that the public are being served.""
He also pointed out that the Indian restaurant sector in the UK is worth an estimated Â£4bn a year.","Indian restaurants are closing in Scotland because strict immigration curbs mean it is difficult to recruit top chefs from the Indian sub-continent, it has been claimed.",39692661
"And even one of those three times  - when it bought 250 million chocolate selection boxes from Woolworths following its  collapse - was a deliberate ploy to attract the retailer's customers to its stores.
It's a story that reflects just how Poundland, despite the cheap and cheerful image,  is a tightly managed business.
Poundland might look a bit basic - the ultimate in pile-it-high, sell-it-cheap - but this is a sophisticated firm with big plans for expansion. And its growth is part of a wider UK success story: the unstoppable rise of the discount retailers.
Overall, the discount sector - including Poundland and its smaller rivals such as Poundworld and Poundstretcher, as well as the  fast-growing supermarket chains Aldi and Lidl - has grown 48% over the past five years, according to retail research firm The Local Data Company.
This compares to the slower 34% expansion of the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Sainsbury - over the same period.
In fact, last year discount stores grew twice as fast as the big four supermarkets with each chain opening an average of 33 shops compared to the 16 opened by each of the bigger players.
This growth in a much improved economy seems surprising, but analysts believe the recession started a much more fundamental shift.
Maureen Hinton, global research director for retail research firm Conlumino, says the careful habits initially borne of necessity have now become entrenched, with people realising they don't have to pay a lot to get good quality products.
She also credits the straightforward everyday pricing strategy of the discounters, compared to the ""opaque"" costs of their bigger rivals for their continuing popularity.
""There's a genuine honesty with pound stores. People have discovered there's the opportunity to buy good stuff at low prices so why pay more?"" she says.
Poundland's customer data backs this up. Far from a shop just for people struggling to make ends meet, it claims to have successfully converted the middle class with a quarter of its customers now from the ""AB"" demographic - the wealthier end of the population.
The discounters are also benefitting from a backlash against their bigger rivals: they're are seen as a welcome outsider, says Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer and business psychologist at University College London.
""The cheap environment, low staffing and basic shop fit outs all help. People think there's no danger here and let their guard down,"" he says.
And conversely, because customers believe that there's no hidden agenda they spend more.
""The no gimmicks, no frills, 'here we are saving money' message means people buy a lot more just because no one is trying to convince them to do it,"" he adds.
In reality, he says people overestimate their ability to understand pricing, with the low pricing creating ""a level of euphoria and excitement"" that interferes with rational decision making, with ""bargain"" signs helping to create a sense of urgency.
""We are hardwired to feel more euphoric, the hunter gatherer instinct pushes us to buy with our shopping driven by missing out rather than acquiring what we need.""
To take advantage of this, most of the discount stores stock a smaller constantly changing range on top of standard staples.
Chris Edwards, the boss of Poundworld, says its bestselling products  are ""everyday grocery items"", including baby wipes, crisps and chocolate.
But he says the chain, which has 280 shops nationwide, each week changes 500 of the 5,000 items it stocks to ""keep up with trends"", such as a range of Minions products to tie in with the forthcoming film release, and give customers ""new and exciting offers"".
The chain has also recently launched an online shop, aimed at expanding its reach.
Poundland's Mr McCarthy says it is ""reasonably well advanced"" with similar plans, but it is also aiming to rapidly expand its physical presence.
It is using the funds from last year's Â£750m flotation on the London Stock Exchange to open more stores with a bullish long term target of opening 1,000 UK stores up from its current network of over 500 stores across the UK and Ireland.
A Â£55m deal to buy smaller rival 99p Stores and convert their shops into Poundlands, which is currently being reviewed by The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), would dramatically hasten its growth.
And in contrast to what you'd expect, Mr McCarthy says the ""good times"" are actually much better for sales.
""We've been going for 25 years and seen two recessions. In good times people feel more confident and go on more shopping trips which means we get more business"".
He is equally upbeat about the firm's growth prospects, pointing to the success of US discount chain Dollar Tree, which has been going for half a century, for proof of Poundland's potential longevity.
But others are less certain, warning that the growth of the discounters has an obvious limit. ""If there are five pound shops on the high street, people are not going to spend five times as much. They are in danger of reaching a peak,"" warns Ms Hinton.
Still, it remains hard to resist the lure of the bargain. Mr McCarthy admits that even he is not immune to the store's charms - describing it as a ""Pandora's box treasure trove"".

It also earned the group an award for Britain's hardest-working band from the Association of Independent Music.
Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. ""We need to be somewhere else,"" he said. ""Not existing is not an option.""
The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it.
Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks.
But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists.
It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups.
Now, however, they have moved out after Sunderland City Council, which owned the building, sold it for student flats.
Pulled Apart By Horses played the shop's final gig on Saturday.
Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises, and that comments from the shop's regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen.
Things like the poetry group, which has 40 members, and the Saturday morning ""stitch and bitch"", will ""stop happening here"", Harper said.
""That's absolutely terrifying because, if you walk around this city, and if you don't want baked pastry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on, I don't know what people do.
""I'm standing here with grease on my hands and I hadn't cried for years until I realised this place was done, and people were saying pleasant things about it. It's really driven home so acutely what this place has meant to people.""
Members of shop's the regular meetings have told him that the groups help with their mental health problems, he said.
""They feel comfortable here and they don't feel comfortable anywhere else that's state sponsored or medication related,"" he said. ""I didn't know we were doing this.
""People have just come and told us recently, and that was infinitely more upsetting, yet satisfying, that we were achieving things we didn't even realise under our own noses.""
The band have always known the council was trying to sell the building, Sunderland City Council's cabinet secretary Councillor Mel Speding said.
""That has now been secured with its development into student accommodation.
""This is in line with council objectives to see more people living and working in the city centre and, in the interests of council tax payers in these financially challenging times for local authorities, it secures a capital receipt.
""Naturally, with the success and popularity of Pop Recs, the council and others have been looking at ways and means of continuing and securing a similar venture elsewhere in the city centre.""",A record shop opened by indie band Frankie and the Heartstrings in their home town of Sunderland two years ago has shut after the premises was sold.,33335482

In another case, an eight-month-old baby was reportedly killed while five security officers gang-raped his mother.

Many told investigators that members of the army or police had burned hundreds of Rohingya homes, schools, markets, shops, and mosques.
Numerous testimonies ""confirmed that the army deliberately set fire to houses with families inside, and in other cases pushed Rohingyas into already burning houses"", the report states.
Many victims said they were taunted as they were being beaten or raped, with the perpetrators telling them: ""What can your Allah do for you? See what we can do?""

"At the start of a trip to China to strengthen post-Brexit business ties, Philip Hammond said he would review economic data over the coming months.
He added that the Treasury will act ""if we deem it necessary to do so"".
Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, dismissed Mr Hammond's plan as ""just warm words from another Tory chancellor"".
And he added: ""As at present the failed austerity policies of George Osborne are still going ahead and the government is still sticking to the failed fiscal framework.
""This means that Britain is on hold until Philip Hammond makes up his mind. The Tories clearly had no plan for Brexit and are making it up as they go along.""
Before becoming Prime Minister, Theresa May had said that the government would no longer seek to reach a surplus by 2020.
Mr Hammond said on Friday: ""Over the medium term we will have the opportunity with our Autumn Statement, our regular late year fiscal event, to reset fiscal policy if we deem it necessary to do so in the light of the data that will emerge over the coming months.""
Following Mr Hammond's statement, figures from IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index revealed a ""dramatic deterioration"" in economic activity in the services and manufacturing sectors in July, which fell to the lowest level since April 2009.
Well, that was a surprise.
Among the warm words on Sino- British relations (the UK still wants to be a major investment partner with China) the new Chancellor of the Exchequer dropped a small grenade.
He said the government would be willing to ""reset fiscal policy"" if it was deemed necessary given the decision on Brexit.
Following on from Theresa May's announcement that the government's 2020 target to eliminate the deficit was no more, Mr Hammond looks like he is considering a radical approach should the economy need a kick start.
That opens up a host of possibilities.
More borrowing?
More infrastructure spending supported by the state as well as private money?
Yes, the government has said it wants to ""live within its means"".
And nothing has been decided.
""Reset"" is only one word, after all, though a significant one.
But, as with Mrs May, Mr Hammond might be rather more headline grabbing on changes in economic direction than some expected.
Particularly if the economy looks sickly ahead of the Autumn Statement.
This week new data showed that public borrowing was lower than expected in June, but it is still expected to overshoot the government's Â£55.5bn full-year borrowing forecast by Â£14bn.
Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the independent think tank, said: ""I think what Mr Hammond was saying was rather similar to what George Osborne was saying about the fact that the government needs to re-think its fiscal rules, it's not going to get to a budget surplus as it planned in 2020 because the economy will slow down.
""We don't know how much, it might be a recession, it might just be a slowdown. That will mean there will be less tax revenue coming in and Mr Hammond is going to have some really tough choices to make in the Autumn Statement. Increase spending? Cut taxes? Or just carry on as we were?""
Mr Hammond is attending his first meeting as chancellor with the G20 finance ministers which is taking place in Chengdu. He will also visit Beijing and Hong Kong.
He declared that Britain was ""open for business"" and was ""one of the most attractive destinations in the world for international investment"".
Before Britain voted to leave the EU, China's Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said the consequences were unclear, but that they would be felt for years to come.
Mr Lou said Brexit would ""cast a shadow over the global economy"" and that the ""repercussions and fallout"" would emerge over the next five to 10 years.","The new Chancellor of the Exchequer has said he may use the Autumn Statement to ""reset"" Britain's economic policy.",36864099

"Figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed more than a quarter of cases were not picked up within the required 24 hours after birth.
Health campaigners say the problem can affect crucial early days of bonding.
A cleft palate is a gap in the roof of the mouth leading to difficulties sucking adequately and trouble feeding.
The condition can also lead to hearing and speech difficulties, and may indicate other problems with the heart or nervous system.
Unlike a cleft lip, a cleft in the palate is hard to identify in a scan during pregnancy. National guidelines say the problem, which affects about 500 babies every year in the UK, should be diagnosed within 24 hours of birth.
This allows quick referral to a team of experts including surgeons, nurses, orthodontists and speech and language therapists.
But figures published by the Royal College of Surgeons show a cleft palate is often missed at birth.
They come from the Crane Database, which is a national register of information on those born with a cleft lip or palate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Crane annual report says last year 28% of babies with a cleft palate alone did not get a diagnosis within 24 hours. And 5% of cases had not been picked up after a month.
The clinical lead of the database, Scott Deacon, says there is a need for stronger guidelines.
He says in the past health staff have been trained to use a finger to feel for the defect, but he insists that a thorough visual check is needed.
""What we're asking for is for people to visibly examine the mouth using a torch and a spatula to get the tongue out of the way. Because obviously a baby is small and it's not the easiest thing to see unless you're getting the tongue depressed and out of the way.""
When Tomas Lewis struggled to feed, his mother Elizabeth was told he might have just been sleepy as a result of her epidural during labour.
It was only four days later, back at home, Tomas's uncle spotted a hole in his mouth as he yawned.
The family did an internet search and made their own diagnosis of a cleft palate - which was confirmed by a health professional the following day. Mrs Lewis says those first few days, when Tomas was losing weight, were ""horrendous"".
But they were then supported by a specialist team, and when he was seven months old Tomas had corrective surgery.
His mother says from that moment he was ""a different little boy"".
Mr Deacon says a failure to diagnose the problem can cause parents great anxiety and distress.
That was the experience of Elizabeth Lewis 16 months ago following the birth of her son Tomas. He struggled to feed and lost weight, but it took four days until his cleft palate was identified.
""I just wasn't able to feed him and give him that important nourishment that he needed. And that is very hard. You start blaming yourself, thinking I must be doing something wrong, there's something wrong with my child.
""It's awful and I wouldn't wish it on anybody,"" she said.
Tomas has had corrective surgery on the cleft, but will require further checks on his speech and hearing.
Rosanna Preston from the Cleft Lip and Palate Association backed the call for better early diagnosis: ""For any parent, noticing that your baby is not eating, feeding properly or gaining weight is terribly worrying.
""Many parents will initially blame themselves until the cause is found and worries about their baby's health can affect those crucial early days of bonding; the sooner they can get support the better.""
A spokesman for the Department of Health said newborn babies deserved nothing less than the best possible care.
""We expect that NHS organisations will want to follow NICE [National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence] guidelines on postnatal care, so that mothers and new babies receive the vital support they need.""","Too many babies born with a cleft palate are being diagnosed late, causing unnecessary distress, the Royal College of Surgeons says.",20695397

"Led by ""generals"" Mohammed Sajjad, 38, from Cardiff, and Imtiaz Ali, 35, from Newport, the group were involved in bringing the class A drug into Wales.
Cardiff Crown Court heard the group was arrested as part of one of the largest undercover operations in Wales.
Four were convicted after trial, while six others pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy from 2013-2014.
Arrests were made after police seized 40kg (88lbs) of the drug in 2014.
Most was found inside a speaker and a suitcase in a car stopped on the M5, while a smaller amount was discovered in the footwell of a taxi in Newport.
Officers said the seizure had prevented half a million drug deals, the court heard.
Sentencing the group, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC, said the gang had dealt in ""industrial quantities"" of the ""highly addictive evil drug"".
There have been more heroin seizures across the South Wales Police force area than anywhere else in Wales and England, outside London, for at least the past three years, according to figures from the Home Office.
During 2014-2015, South Wales Police made 303 heroin seizures per million people. The average for Wales and England was 135 seizures per million.

"The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would place a legal duty on internet providers to assist in hacking devices.
But it would not be restricted to phones and PCs, a tech industry chief told the Commons science and technology committee.
Antony Walker, of techUK, said anything that connected to the internet could ""in theory"" be hacked into.
In the future, this could include driverless cars or household appliances connected to the internet - the so-called Internet of Things - said Mr Walker.
He said the Home Office needed to spell out more clearly where it draws the line over what it calls ""equipment interference"", highlighting recent concerns about ""smart toys"" that connect to the internet and have microphones and cameras built-in.
""A range of devices that have been in the news recently, in relation to a hack, are children's toys, that children can interact with,"" he told the committee.
""These are devices that may sit in a child's bedroom but are accessible.
""In theory, the manufacturer of those products could be the subject of a warrant to enable equipment interference with those devices.
""So the potential extent, I think, is something that needs to be carefully considered.""
In November, electronic toy company Vtech had its app store database hacked, allegedly resulting in the appearance online of personal data including children's names, dates of birth and gender.
Talking dolls, such as Hello Barbie and My Friend Cayla, have also been put under scrutiny by security experts in recent months.
Barbie manufacturer Mattel reportedly made modifications to Hello Barbie, which allows children to talk to the doll over a cloud server connection, after concerns were raised about cyber attackers potentially stealing data through it.
The police, security services, HM Revenue and Customs and other law enforcement agencies can already hack into devices provided they get a warrant.
This allows them to download the contents of computers or smartphones, track locations, listen to calls, or even switch on microphones and cameras, allowing officers to listen in to conversations or take pictures of those standing nearby.
The Home Office says these powers, the existence of which were revealed earlier this year following a court case, have ""made a vital contribution to counter the increased threat to the UK from Islamist terrorism and have also enabled the disruption of paedophile-related crime"", according to a Home Office fact sheet.
The draft Investigatory Powers Bill would put ""equipment interference"" warrants on a firmer legal footing and make sure they are ""only used when necessary and proportionate for a legitimate purpose"".
A revised bill will be introduced to Parliament in the New Year, following consultation and scrutiny by the industry and other interested parties.
Mr Walker, whose organisation represents 850 UK technology firms, told MPs it needed to be more forward-looking and less vague about the limits of surveillance.
""When we start to think, not just about the world today, but the world in five, 10 years' time as the Internet of Things becomes more real, and more pervasive.

""It is Theresa May's extreme version of Brexit which will cause real damage to the NHS,"" he added.
The prime minister gave a speech earlier on Tuesday in which she stressed that she was the best person to lead talks on leaving the EU.
She also told the audience in Wolverhampton: ""If we don't make a success of Brexit, we won't have the financial means to fund the public services on which we all rely.
""Our National Health Service - the institution which is there for us at the most difficult times - needs us to make a success of Brexit to ensure we can afford to provide it with the resources it needs for the future.""
Mr Clegg responded: ""By insisting on dragging the UK out of the single market, she has chosen a UKIP-style version of Brexit which is already causing a squeeze on public services.""
""It's time she came clean that the risks are all of her own making. It is her choice to take this country in a dangerous and damaging direction.""

"Those were the days, by the way, when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change.
“Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera?” shouted a producer in London. “If not, why not?”
This appeared to be an impossible demand.
Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle.
Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre. Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone.
He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony Ive or order 5,000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage, I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O’Clock News piece.
The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “a fragment of the true cross”, and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch.
I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we’d had a TV news bulletin back then.
Afterwards, I rather regretted saying that  - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership?
But today that comparison does not look so outlandish. The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade,  putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries.
One example is in the photograph at the top of this article. It’s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera. In difficult lighting conditions, I struggled to get Steve Jobs in focus on stage.
Compare and contrast with a photo taken 10 years later in Las Vegas last week - it was shot on an iPhone but could just as well been captured on any high-end smartphone such as a Google Pixel, and was the work of the same incompetent photographer.
This 2017 photo could be instantly shared on social media - the Steve Jobs one stayed in my SLR for days.
My point is that the iPhone radically changed the way we thought about photography and a whole range of other activities we could now do on the move.
Of course, there were cameras on phones before 2007, just as there were mobile devices that allowed you to roam the internet or send an email. But the genius of Steve Jobs was to realise that without an attractive user interface many people just couldn’t be bothered to do more with their phones than talk and text.
So, despite my rather British distaste for the hyperbole surrounding the iPhone launch - expressed at the time in a blog - I now look back and feel grateful to have witnessed a moment in history.
Other firms, notably Amazon and Google, are now taking us forward with innovative products imbued with artificial intelligence. But it was on a sunny January morning in San Francisco that the mobile connected era began.",Ten years ago I was running from San Francisco’s Moscone Centre to a nearby hotel to edit a piece for the Ten O’Clock News when my phone rang.,38550016
"The animal charity said there were 297 convictions last year in Wales, a rise of 20%, following an increase in the number of animal welfare cases reported.
RSPCA Cymru's Steve Carter said workers faced ""immense demands"".
The charity said the economic downturn was probably still partly to blame with some people unable to look after pets.
The 100% conviction rate was up from 97.8%.
Mr Carter said it demonstrated ""how robust our investigative process is"".
The number of animals rescued or collected also more than doubled, which the charity says is more positive.
Other figures reported for 2013:
HORSE SUFFERING: A Gwynedd horse breeder allowed his ponies to suffer so much that nine had to be put down.
Evan Lloyd Evans, 69, was jailed for 10 weeks after being found guilty of multiple animal welfare offences in October 2013.
The conditions the horses were kept in were described as ""appalling and completely inappropriate"".
EMACIATED DOGS: In another case, a married couple from Pembrokeshire were banned from keeping dogs for five years after their dogs were found to be so emaciated that one of them - a lurcher - weighed less than a cat.
CATS LEFT TO BREED: A mother and daughter from Wrexham who neglected 17 cats in their care were disqualified from keeping all animals indefinitely. The family had left the cats to breed uncontrollably with only one of their cats being neutered. Several, including the two kittens, had to be put to sleep because of their serious health issues. Both women were given community orders.
'WORST' FLEA INFESTATION: A suspended sentence and life ban were given to a Pontypridd man, 55, who had a cat with the worst flea infestation the vet had ever seen.
The cat, which was found living in squalid conditions in an upstairs bedroom, recovered. The man had previously been prosecuted by the RSPCA regarding two of his dogs.

The RSPCA believes the economic downturn could still be playing in part in the increase in cases reported to it, where people are unable to look after pets which in some cases leads to neglect.
The charity said social media was also playing a part in raising the profile of the charity's work.
""We are getting people reporting cases on Twitter but we'd really encourage them to contact our helpline as the first port of call, and those messages we receive on social media we refer on to there,"" said a spokesman.
Mr Carter said the rise in cautions reflected how the charity had tried to work with people to educate them.

We also want to see courts taking these offences far more seriously,"" he said.","The RSPCA has had a 100% success rate for its prosecutions after facing a ""growing animal cruelty crisis"".",27890466

"Southern Cross is holding a crisis meeting with landlords, lenders and government officials.
Of central importance is how to ensure continuity of care for the 31,000 people at the firm's 751 care homes.
The care home provider says it cannot afford to pay the full rent on its homes.
Families and staff 'in the dark'Q&A: Care home closures
Landlords will agree to a compromise in order to allow the care home provider to remain solvent, the BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, has learned.
The restructuring may leave the Darlington-based firm with just 250 to 400 homes, with the others being taken over by different care providers.
But the biggest landlord, NHP, which owns 249 of the homes, is expected to stick with Southern Cross.
The government has been putting intense pressure on landlords not to abandon Southern Cross altogether, according to Robert Peston.
Southern Cross said last month it planned to stop paying about a third of its rental bill.
The company's landlords met on Monday, and are expected to table their own proposal for the firm's future at the meeting on Wednesday.

"The draft guidelines propose that two doctors rather than one should make the assessment.
It describes as a grey area the lawfulness of advocating or promoting terminations outside Northern Ireland.
The draft guidelines are still being considered by ministers and will be consulted on for 16 weeks.
The document, titled 'the limited circumstances for lawful termination in Northern Ireland', include a recommendation that a consultant psychiatrist should be involved where a mental health assessment is required.
There is an allowance for conscientious objection and a new section dealing with accountability and collecting data on each abortion - the reason given must be clearly documented.
Abortion is only allowed in very restricted circumstances in Northern Ireland.
Justice Minister David Ford has called for clarification on some of the guidelines and said the document could lead to more confusion.
""On an issue like abortion we need to have a law which is absolutely clear and not something that brings further confusion and disarray to the legislation,"" he said.
In February, a judicial review in the High Court by the Family Planning Association (FPA) to have guidelines issued on the law on abortion in Northern Ireland, was halted after the department of health promised to publish draft advice within a week.
The FPA had been campaigning for more than a decade for guidelines to be issued on abortion for the NHS in Northern Ireland.
After previous legal action by the charity, the department of health issued a 20-page document in 2009 containing guidance for health professionals on the termination of pregnancy in Northern Ireland.
It was withdrawn the following year after a successful legal challenge by anti-abortion campaigners led to a ruling that sections on counselling and conscientious objection should be rewritten.
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said its members were working from the earlier draft guidelines, described by government officials as having ""no status"".
Meanwhile, two Stormont assembly members are attempting to change the law to make it illegal to perform an abortion outside the NHS. It follows the opening of the private Marie Stopes International clinic in Belfast last year.
The DUP's Paul Givan, who chairs the justice committee, and the SDLP's Alban Maginness have tabled a joint amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill.
The laws covering abortion in Northern Ireland are the 1861 Offences against the Person Act,  and the Criminal Justice act from 1945.  It is a criminal offence, which carries a life sentence.
The only exceptions are to save a woman's life, or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
Last year official figures confirmed that at least 40 terminations a year are carried out on these grounds.
More than a thousand women a year who do not fit in these categories travel from Northern Ireland each year to have an abortion in other parts of the UK.
In England, Wales and Scotland access to abortion is covered by the 1967 Abortion Act.  That permits terminations up to 24 weeks of pregnancy on grounds that include risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or existing children in the family, and abnormalities that could lead to a child being ""seriously handicapped"".
It is also allowed over 24 weeks if a woman's life or health is at serious risk, and for serious disabilities.","The Northern Ireland health minister, Edwin Poots, has circulated a 30 page draft document to executive colleagues on long-awaited abortion guidelines.",21712388
"Broadchurch star Tennant plays the debauched lead character in Don Juan in Soho.
Patrick Marber's play - first seen in 2006 - has been updated and now includes references to US President Donald Trump and vlogging.
Speaking after Tuesday's opening night, Tennant revealed that Marber had written in a line about the Daily Mail's controversial ""Legs-it"" headline, but it didn't make the show.
""We chickened out at the last second!"" he told the BBC.
""We are sprinkling occasional contemporary references as we go. We add them on the day. Prince George is in his third day now. George Osborne lasted for a weekend. Donald Trump is in there.""
Tennant added: ""Obviously it has to relate to Don Juan and his world view. He's got this fury about the hypocrisy of the world that he's in.
""The world keeps presenting itself with fresh material and we can't really resist.""
Marber's play is a loose adaptation of Moliere's 17th Century tragi-comedy Don Juan that transports the legendary womaniser to contemporary London.
Tennant's character - known as DJ - describes himself in the play as the ""Dalai Lama of debauchery"".
At one point his servant Stan, played by Adrian Scarborough, urges the audience: ""Please don't be charmed, he's not a lovable rogue...""

"Police hope the scheme will help reduce financial crime by spotting scams before money has been handed over.
The plan is to train every single front-facing employee of banks, building societies and Post Offices.
Cash payments to fraudsters are typically much harder to trace than online payments with the vast majority of cases going unsolved.
Typical frauds of this kind include paying rogue builders, romance scams and elderly abuse.
'It just didn't add up'
Staff at one bank which has trialled the scheme helped stop a customer being swindled out of £13,000.
Ray, who is in his 60s, was approached by a builder at his home in London about some work on his house.
He had withdrawn £6,000 from his local branch after explaining to staff what it was going to be used for.
But when he returned a week later to take out another £13,000 he was recognised by staff member Ann-Marie.
She asked him questions about his cash withdrawal which raised suspicions.
Ray handed over the flier he had been given with the builder's contact details and staff gave him a call.
Ann-Marie added: ""The person that answered wasn't very professional and the alarm bells started to ring. Plus the amount he [Ray] wanted to cash and the work he needed done just didn't add up.""
Staff contacted the police who visited Ray the next day when the builder was at his property.
Officers did a background check on the builder and which uncovered suspicious activity and he was arrested.
The new scheme, known as the Banking Protocol, is aimed at ensuring banks and police are more active in protecting customers.
It is being run as a joint venture between the police, Financial Fraud Action - which represents banks - and Trading Standards.
All customer-facing bank staff will be told to look out for specific signs that a client may be the victim of ongoing fraud.
If they have suspicions, they are encouraged to call the police and give a special password.
Police trained under the protocol will also commit to investigating the fraud as a priority - often visiting the bank branch, or the customer's home, immediately.
In some cases, they may be able to catch the criminal waiting outside the bank or the victim's home to collect the cash.
Bank staff taking part in the trial scheme in London made 178 calls to police which resulted in 16 arrests.

"James Purnell said it would increase non-payment and cost the BBC £200m.
The sum is the equivalent of BBC Four, CBBC and CBeebies, which would have to be taken off air, Mr Purnell said at an event to  relaunch the iPlayer service.
Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the BBC's charter before 2017.
Mr Purnell, who previously held the post in the Labour government, said ""it would be a huge risk to do it now"".
""The choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,"" he said in reference to BBC Four - the arts and culture channel - and the BBC's children's stations.
He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the TV licence, which would force an increase in the fee.
It is currently £145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device.
In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions.
Mr Purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor.
""Either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,"" he said.
The BBC has previously said ""legislation is a matter for the government"".
""Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations,"" it added.
The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system.
But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the BBC is funded what it does and how it is managed.
The current BBC charter runs out in 2016.
Meanwhile, Labour MP John McDonnell has tabled an Early Day Motion in parliament calling on the BBC to reverse its decision to close BBC Three as a television channel.

"The software giant shared the details with tech news sites Digital Foundry and Eurogamer.
The console has reportedly been designed from the start to make newer games playable at ultra-high 4K resolutions and at high frame rates.
The console's graphics chip uses 40 high-speed processing cores to produce the high-definition images.
Detailed specifications shared with the websites reveal that the hardware inside the console will have a central processor with eight cores that run at 2.3GHz. By contrast, the eight cores in Sony's PS4 Pro run at 2.1Ghz and those in the Xbox One at 1.75GHz.
The 40 cores in the graphics unit also run at a higher speed than those in the 36 cores in the Sony console and the 12 in the Xbox One. Microsoft said it set itself a target of making the whole device capable of handling six teraflops per second - one it claims to have hit.
Eurogamer estimates that the graphical processing unit inside the Scorpio box is 4.6 times more powerful than the chips in the Xbox One. Just as important, it said, was the amount of memory available to games.
""That means fast streaming of very high-quality art assets, which will really help at the 4K ultra HD resolutions that Microsoft is gunning for,"" said Eurogamer editor Oli Welsh.
However, he added that the magazine's reporters had seen only one demo, that used a very well-refined game engine.
Piers Harding-Rolls, a games industry analyst at IHS Technology, said the powerful hardware would help Microsoft distinguish the new devices from the Xbox One S and give it credibility with gamers keen to get the latest hardware.
Scorpio's ability to handle 4K resolutions should also help align its Xbox and Windows PC gaming strategies.
He added: ""Third-party publishers that are developing games for both PC and console are progressively developing 4K level content, so the overhead to develop for this new platform is not as onerous as seems at first glance.""
Seth Barton from game news site MCV said Microsoft still had some key decisions to take with the console.
""Price is the real key here,"" he wrote, adding that the hardware shown suggested the cost would be higher than Â£400.
""For most it simply remains a very powerful console, without a clear marketing plan or a price,"" he said. ""And so we're no closer to seeing how Microsoft is going to turn the silicon into a saleable product.""

"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, General Lord Dannatt said it was wrong to ""talk up"" the incidents.
Five Afghan soldiers died in an assault on the former UK base Camp Bastion and capital city Kabul has been attacked.
Lord Dannatt said the Afghan government must retain the support of the West.
The last UK combat troops left Afghanistan in October, with Camp Bastion in Helmand Province being handed over to local armed forces.
But there has been a surge in insurgent attacks over the past month, targeting Afghan forces, foreigners and civilians. It has raised concerns about whether Afghan security forces will be able to protect the country when the bulk of the other foreign troops depart this month.
Three South Africans were killed in a Taliban attack on a compound used by a US-based charity on Saturday in Kabul, the third such incident on foreigners in 10 days.
Ahead of a conference this week on Afghanistan's future in London, Lord Dannatt said: ""It is important the new government shows it has competence and confidence to govern... it is absolutely critical to show international determination to go on financing and supporting the developing Afghanistan.""
He said: ""The security situation is an important element in this but don't let's fall into the trap of playing the Taliban's game and talking up the number of attacks...
""Of course there are going to be attacks... a low level, even a medium level degree of insecurity and a continuing insurgency is quite likely, but let's keep the wider picture in mind.""
The Ministry of Defence said Afghan security forces are providing effective security and the recent incidents do not represent the situation across the country.
Lord Dannatt's predecessor, General Sir Mike Jackson, has reiterated his view that the UK withdrew from Afghanistan too soon.
Interviewed on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""The war, conflict, call it what you will, wasn't over. I'm left feeling there was no victory despite what the politicians say.""
But he said that while the recent attacks were ""somewhat depressing... I don't see certainly at the moment, and I hope never, that the Taliban will be in a position where they can overthrow the elected government of Afghanistan"".
He said ""great effort"" has been put into training and mentoring the Afghan security forces.
Sir Mike, who led the Army between 2003 and 2006 at the height of the UK's involvement in Afghanistan, added: ""Afghanistan is not a military problem per se, the root of it is political.

It said: ""Ensure your team has… identified your target key customers to demonstrate our popular feature game. Offer a demo to all of your machine customers to whet their appetite, then encourage them to play with their own money.
""Once you have identified your target customers, it often helps when you use a 'hook' to encourage them to play. 'You like Big Banker, do you have our bonus card yet? It's quick, it's easy and it's free.'""
Case study: 'Red mist' of gambling
Tony Franklin has had a problem with gambling since he was a child. He had managed to stay out of the bookies for a year, but over a couple of hours 18 months ago, he blew it all.
Having avoided high-street bookmakers for a year, he cleaned out his bank account in just an hour after a trip to the barbers.  As he left he was drawn to one of the many betting shops on his high street and one of its FOBTs.
""I was totally devastated and just completely caught up in the gambling, in the red mist of it,"" he says.
His addiction has had a devastating effect on his personal relationships.  He had been due to bring his wife and child over to the UK to set up home but his expensive relapse put his plans on indefinite hold.
Now Tony keeps his betting shop receipts from that day as a reminder of how quickly he can lose control when faced with temptation. He feels the industry should be doing more to stop addicts like him losing control.
Under the industry's code of conduct, all staff should be trained to identify and help problem gamblers.
But one woman, who works for another unnamed bookmakers, said that did not always happen.
""I have never actually been trained. All we have is a leaflet and are told to give them out if we feel people have a problem. But working on your own at night, or even in the morning, makes it extremely hard to hand out leaflets and speak to customers who are clearly frustrated,"" she said.
Malcolm George, from the Association of British Bookmakers, said: ""It is absolutely the case that anyone joining and working in a betting shop will receive training about problem gambling.""
Coral said it rejected the allegations made by the BBC.
It added in its statement: ""Recent health surveys show that problem gambling rates have in fact fallen since the introduction of FOBTs and the average Coral customer's loss per session on a FOBT is around £6-9.
""The introduction of supervised stakes above £50 from April last year has had a profound change in customer behaviour, with an approximate 70% reduction in stakes above that level.
""Training, tools and processes are in place throughout the business to ensure that potential problem gamblers are identified and protected.""

"Goals from Robert Wurube and James Moga helped South Sudan complete a 4-1 overall victory in the Central Eastern Zone qualifier to set up a meeting with Uganda in the next round.
On Saturday, Malawi and Seychelles went out to Madagascar and Mauritius respectively.
The CHAN - a tournament for locally-based African players featuring in their own country's domestic leagues - will be staged in Kenya from 12 January to 4 February 2018.
Malawi were beaten 1-0 at home in the second leg of their opening Southern Zone qualifier with Madagascar winning 2-0 on aggregate.
Seychelles could only draw the second leg of their qualifier in Mahé 1-1 as Mauritius progressed 3-2 overall.
Madgascar had Rokotoarimaldla Tsilavina to thank for their victory in Lilongwe as he scored the only goal just after the break, beating advancing Malawi goal-keeper Ernest Kakhobwe.
The visitors were then the better side for most of the second half, displaying offensive and passing football.
Malawi were left to rue their three missed chances in the first half with striker Muhammad Sulumba the main culprit after his weak shot from inside the six-yard box was easily stopped by the Madagascar keeper.
The defeat to Madagascar means Malawi's new coach Ronny Van Geneugden is without a win in three games.
The result will provide food for thought for Malawi who bolstered their squad on return from Madagascar by including among others former captain Joseph Kamwendo and forwards Binwell Katinji and Ishmael Thindwa .
Madagascar will play Mozambique in the next round.
On a good day for Indian Ocean nations, Mauritius sealed their place in the next round of the CHAN qualifiers with a 1-1 draw against Seychelles at the Stad Linité in Mahé to progress 3-2 on aggregate.
On a rainy afternoon, Mauritius opened the scoring with a 14th minute goal from defender Marco Dorza.
Mauritius thought they had doubled the lead but Kevin Perticot's goal was disallowed for offside.

"The 50 planes around the world were grounded due to battery malfunctions that saw one 787 catch fire in the US.
Over the past week teams of Boeing engineers have been fitting new batteries to the aircraft.
This was after aviation authorities approved the revamped battery design.
The Ethiopian Airlines plane took off at 09:45 local time (07:45 GMT) and landed in Nairobi, Kenya, some two hours later.
Each 787 has two of the lithium-ion batteries which caused problems.
In addition to new versions of the batteries which run at a much cooler temperature, the batteries are now enclosed in stainless steel boxes.
These boxes have a ventilation pipe that goes directly to the outside of the plane. Boeing says this means than in the unlikely event of any future fire or smoke, it would not affect the rest of the aircraft.
By Richard WestcottBBC transport correspondent, Nairobi
Flight ETH 801 between Addis Ababa and Nairobi wasn't exactly a run-of-the-mill flight.
For starters, it was full of Boeing executives and the boss of Ethiopian Airlines. Several passengers on board asked me what was going on, why was the BBC on a routine flight in Africa?
Many didn't realise that they were the first passengers to fly in a Dreamliner since it was dramatically grounded in January. There were plenty who knew about the safety scare surrounding the plane, although only a couple that we spoke to said it had made them a little more tentative about flying.
Boeing still has a huge job on its hands, convincing passengers that its most high-profile, most hi-tech airliner is safe.
Two senior Boeing executives went out of their way this week to tell me that they'd happily put their family on the plane. It's the kind of quote that sounds good.
Still, Boeing will be desperately hoping that its Dreamliner nightmare doesn't come back to haunt it.
Boeing said it put 200,000 engineer hours into fixing the problem, with staff working round the clock.
On Thursday, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a formal ""air worthiness"" directive allowing revamped 787s to fly.
Japanese airlines, which have been the biggest customers for the new-generation aircraft, are expected to begin test flights on Sunday.
A total of 300 Boeing engineers, pooled into 10 teams, have in the past week been fitting the new batteries and their containment systems around the world.
Boeing is expected to complete repairs on all 50 of the grounded Dreamliners by the middle of May.
In addition to the Dreamliners in service with airlines, Boeing has upgraded the 787s it has continued to make at its factory in Seattle since January.
The Dreamliner entered service in 2011.  Half of the plane is made from lightweight composite materials, making it more fuel efficient than other planes of the same size.
The two lithium-ion batteries are not used when the 787 is in flight.
They are operational when the plane is on the ground and its engines are not turned on, and are used to power the aircraft's brakes and lights.","An Ethiopian Airlines 787 Dreamliner has flown from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, the first commercial flight by the Boeing aircraft since all 787s were grounded in January.",22315317
"Following the revelations of inappropriate relationships, the home affairs select committee has called for an urgent review of laws governing undercover policing.
Here are the women's accounts of how they felt when it emerged that their relationships, which lasted from two to six years, were based on deception. These are not their real names.
""I was absolutely shocked and devastated,"" she told MPs.
Lisa had a six-year relationship with former PC Mark Kennedy, who posed as long-haired dropout Mark ""Flash"" Stone to infiltrate a group of environmental protesters.
""You imagine that somebody may be in public meetings that environmental groups have. You imagine there might be somebody listening in there. You could even imagine that your phone might be tapped or that somebody might look at your emails.
""But to know that there was somebody in your bed for six years, that somebody was involved in your family life to such a degree, that was an absolute shock.
""Well, 'shock' is an understatement. It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me and my sense of what was reality and what wasn't was completely turned on its head.""
During the hearing she was asked whether she had any sympathy for Mr Kennedy, who is suing the Metropolitan Police claiming he had been traumatised by what had happened.
""As a human being it is very difficult not to have sympathy for somebody that I cared about deeply, but it is also important to remember that that person that I cared about deeply did not in fact exist,"" she replied.
She adds that she still has questions about what happened.
""Who was listening in to our most intimate phone calls? Who saw our holiday photos? Was there anybody following us when we were on holiday?
""Who made the decisions about what happened to my life, where I was allowed to go, who I was allowed to see, which I thought was my free will but actually was being manipulated by this person who was being controlled by other people?""
""We weren't married, clearly, but we shared the same flat. He was completely integrated into my life for five years and then one day he disappeared,"" she said.
Alison had a relationship with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy, who she met through a group she was involved with in 1994. But he was in fact an undercover police officer. She told MPs the revelation had an ""enormous impact"" on her life.
""The experience has left me with many, many unanswered questions, and one of those that comes back is: how much of the relationship was real?,"" she told MPs.
""Some of the consequences of that have meant that I have, for the last 13 years, questioned my own judgment and it has impacted seriously on my ability to trust, and that has impacted on my current relationship and other subsequent relationships.
Alison, a peaceful campaigner involved in left-wing political causes, believes she inadvertently provided him with ""an excellent cover story"", helping persuade other activists he was genuine.
She said he became totally integrated into her family, appearing in her mother's wedding photograph, accompanying her on holidays and supporting her through the bereavement of a close friend.
""This is not about just a lying boyfriend or a boyfriend who has cheated on you. It is not even about a boyfriend who is having another relationship with somebody else. It is about a fictional character who was created by the state and funded by taxpayers' money.""
""You do not know who you can trust any more. It destroys everything,"" she said.
When the boyfriend Clare knew as John Barker disappeared two years into their relationship, she was determined to track him down. She found a death certificate for his name, and discovered he had been using the identity of a child who had died of leukaemia aged eight.
She visited the child's house, but their parents no longer lived there.
""He had told me that his parents were dead when we were in a relationship, so I wasn't expecting to see the parents, but I thought that if I went there... he had been a missing person for however long and I was desperate to find him. I was really concerned about his welfare,"" she explained.
""Nothing made sense of what had happened, and so I went there desperate, thinking I have to follow every clue that I have, and I thought maybe some other members of the family may still live there or somebody might know where he was.""
She said people trying to justify the practice saying things like it prevented terrorism, was very distressing.
""This is not about a need to do it. It is about a desire to do it. They have the power and they think they can get away with it. That is what it is about.
""It is deeply distressing, and I do not think it should be allowed in any circumstances. It is so intrusive into people's lives, and, as my friends have said, it turns your life upside down.

"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found.
Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients.
The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"".
At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation.
In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15.
It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"".
""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG.
Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"".
Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern.
The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition.
Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust.
He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals.
""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms.""
Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15.
He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital.
""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained.
""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.""
Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs
The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020.
NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.
Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are groups of GPs that work together to plan and design local health services.
There are more than 200 CCGs across England and, according to Pulse, at least nine are offering payments for keeping within targets for outpatient referrals and follow ups. It is not clear how extensive the practice is elsewhere.
Some have questioned the wisdom of the move, saying patients could miss out on vital care. But CCGs have defended their stance, saying it is about good practice, not about keeping people who need treatment out of hospital.
In November the NHS advisory board said GPs in England should nearly double the number of patients referred to hospital for cancer tests.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence said delays in spotting symptoms could be costing thousands of lives each year.
NHS England said: ""We explicitly want to increase not deter appropriate referrals for cancer checks.""
Dr Rosie Loftus of the charity Macmillan Cancer Support described the findings outlined in Pulse as ""very worrying"".
""This is yet another sign of an NHS which is seriously over stretched and not giving GPs the resources and support they need,"" she said.
NHS Lambeth Clinical Commissioning Group, which offers payments for practices moving towards the average referral rate, said, like all CCGs, it wanted to reduce the number of patients being sent to hospitals unnecessarily.
""The part of the payment relating to the rate of referrals is a small part of the funding and is not designed to stop GPs referring patients who have a clinical need for hospital treatment such as cancer patients,"" said a spokesperson.","Some doctors in England are being offered thousands of pounds to cut the number of patients being sent to hospital, an investigation has found.",34421115

His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: ""Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven.""
She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.""
The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.
Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.
The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.
The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.
Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.
The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.
""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.
""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.""
At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.
The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.
He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.
Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.
On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.
At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.
""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.
""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.""
In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.
After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.

"That's how one financier described Dominic Chappell's plans for acquiring and reviving BHS to MPs today.
Andrew Frangos of Cornhill Capital was approached by the three-time bankrupt Chappell to raise money secured against property to use as working capital - the money you need for day to day running of a company.
Mr Frangos said that BHS was not the limit of his ambitions and that Chappell had plans to one day buy Arcadia - the parent company run by Sir Philip Green. Ultimately, Chappell didn't use Cornhill Capital and the two of them are in dispute over unpaid bills.
He was joined in the commons by representatives from accountants Grant Thornton and lawyers Olswang to explain their involvement as advisers to Mr Chappell.
Both made extensive use of client confidentiality protection but several important themes emerged.
Retail Acquisitions Limited did not delve very deeply into the pension problems. Meetings between Chappell and the Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension scheme, totalled less than half an hour and Grant Thornton's Mark Byers said he was denied the usual access to the pension trustees and their advisors.
On the bigger picture, MPs asked what the professional advisers made of this ""punt"". Why did they believe that a retail novice with a chequered financial background could succeed in turning BHS around when a feted retail tycoon had failed? We got two interesting answers.
First, a central part of the turnaround plan involved getting the landlords for the 164 stores to agree to reduce the rent. Mark Byers, from Grant Thornton said it would be difficult to have that negotiation, for BHS essentially to plead poverty, as long as BHS was part of the bigger Arcadia group.
Second, it wasn't their job.
So far there is no smoking gun. What is emerging from these sessions is that lots of professional firms were tasked with making sure small bits of the deal ticked a number of boxes. No one, it seems, was there to look Mr Chappell in the eye and judge whether he had the ability, or even the intention, of making BHS work.
MPs will no doubt suggest that role fell to Sir Philip Green himself as the seller. He appears before the committees on 8 June.","""A bit of a punt"" - the BHS business plan.",36382450

"Many in the list have been found down old mine tunnels or on slag heaps where water and even fire have had the opportunity to work up novel compounds.
It is another example, the researchers argue, of our pervasive influence on the planet.
New minerals and mineral-like compounds are now being formed faster than at anytime in Earth's history, they say.
""These 200 minerals are roughly 4% of the total known minerals, but they all occurred in the last couple of thousand years, most in the last couple of hundred years,"" explained Robert Hazen from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.
""That's an incredible rapid spike in the rise of mineral species unmatched in the history of our planet,"" he told BBC News.
The only period that bears comparison is the time when oxygen became abundant over the surface of the Earth just over two billion years ago. But that event would have played out over millions of years.
Minerals are specific combinations of chemical elements arranged into crystalline structures. Earth's rocks are built from different aggregations.
The likes of feldspar, quartz and mica will be known by most people. But bobcookite, calclacite, or elyite are obscure, to say the least.
Their existence is down to humans creating a setting where chemical reactions can take place between materials that might otherwise not have come into contact.
In addition to mines, which seem to be a particularly productive environment, the new minerals have been found to occur inside smelters, old geothermal piping, on the surfaces of archaeological artefacts, even inside museum specimen drawers.
The 208 man-mediated minerals are listed by Prof Hazen and colleagues in a paper just published by the American Mineralogist.
They have all been approved by the International Mineralogical Association. This organisation operates some quite tight definitions on the sorts of compounds that can appear among the 5,200 entries in the official catalogue. And the group that does not make the grade is the huge number of mineral-like materials that have been manufactured by humans for a specific purpose.
""Human synthesise thousands and thousands of materials - semi-conductors, and laser crystals, and magnets, and batteries, and building stone,"" said Prof Hazen.  ""These have mineral-like materials that will persist in the geological record for the next billion years.""
It is further evidence, if more were needed, that Earth has now entered a new epoch.
Currently, geologists label the time since the last ice age, 11,700 years ago, as the Holocene. But there is a push to introduce a new classification to reflect the immense, planet-wide changes driven by humans in recent decades - and for it to be called the Anthropocene Epoch.
The list of new man-mediated minerals bolsters the case.
Co-worker Marcus Origlieri from the University of Arizona commented: ""In the sediment layers left behind from our age, future mineralogists will find plentiful building materials such as bricks, cinder blocks, and cement, metal alloys such as steel, titanium, and aluminium, along with many lethal radioactive byproducts of the nuclear age. They might also marvel at some beautiful manufactured gemstones, like cubic zirconia, moissanite, synthetic rubies, and many others.""
And Edward Grew from the University of Maine added: ""These minerals and mineral-like compounds will be preserved in the geological record as a distinctive, globally distributed horizon of crystalline novelty - a persistent marker that marks our age as different from all that came before.""
Colin Waters, from the British Geological Survey, is secretary to the Anthropocene Working Group, which is the body trying to draw up detailed criteria to define the proposed new epoch.
He echoed the statements of Prof Hazen's team. The great changes occurring on Planet Earth were being reflected in the mineralogical record, just as they were in the chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans, he said.
And Dr Waters highlighted the ball-point pen as an example.
""The ball at the end is made from tungsten carbide. Billions of them have been produced since the 1950s. Imagine how much of that material is knocking around the planet.
""We're ingenious at creating new mineral-like materials for our own purpose, and it is actually these that will be the voluminous signature of our presence on the planet, rather than some fairly obscure mineral that develops in a mine as a result of our excavation and then later alteration.""
Prof Hazen's team is part of the Deep Carbon Observatory, an international network of nearly 1000 multi-disciplinary scientists committed to investigating the quantities, movements, forms, and origins of carbon in deep Earth.

"Kelly Pearce, 36, was found with fatal throat wounds in a flat belonging to witness Joseph Withers on Canvey Island, Essex, on 19 November.
Accused Anthony Ayres, 49, of Fairlop Avenue in Canvey, denies murdering her.
At Chelmsford Crown Court his defence claimed Mr Withers killed her and then blamed Mr Ayres who arrived later.
Ms Pearce had been stabbed 40 times in the face and neck and bludgeoned to death with a weapon ""consistent"" with a hammer in a ""frenzied attack"", the court heard.
More on this and other news from Essex
She sustained fatal neck wounds and skull and brain damage, and died later in hospital.
The court was told she had been attacked in the bathroom of a flat in Fairlop Avenue in Canvey, belonging to Mr Withers.
On the day of the killing, Mr Withers, who described himself in police interviews as a paranoid schizophrenic, said he was briefly locked out of his flat, while Ms Pearce and Mr Ayres were inside.
When he got back in he claimed to have seen Mr Ayres swinging a hammer.
""I saw him hitting her with the hammer or something. I just saw him hitting like that,"" he told the court.
Defence lawyer Oliver Saxby, QC, said: ""It sounds like you weren't sure. Why did you say 'or something'?""
""That's best description I could give,"" Mr Withers replied.
He claimed he had then run from the flat to call the police.
However, Mr Saxby said: ""I'm suggesting that either you lost it with her, or that there was somebody else in there who was responsible for what happened.""
""It was Tony,"" Mr Withers replied.
He had said early in the cross-examination: ""You're trying to say I attacked Kelly. I would never attack anybody. I'm scared of Kelly.""

""Cannonball"" Ken is also known as the ""Sheriff"" among his Scarlets team-mates, and has no objection to either.
But ""super sub"" was one the Wales hooker, who wins his 50th-cap against France in the Six Nations on Saturday, did not relish.
Owens, 30, has made 31 of his previous 49 Wales appearances from the bench.
During Wales' 2015 World Cup campaign, coach Warren Gatland repeatedly praised Owens' contribution in the latter part of matches while acknowledging the player was frustrated by his long run among the replacements.
That, however, has changed this season with Owens having started all of Wales' Six Nations matches and earned praise from pundits for the quality of his performances.
""You do get frustrated, but you can't let it drag you down,"" Owens says.
""You have got to keep plugging away, just keep trying to improve yourself.
""At the end of the day, it's much better to be involved in the 23 than not being involved at all, whether that be with your region or with Wales.
""I will always push myself to want to start, and thankfully I have had my opportunity now. I have got to keep playing well because there are plenty of hookers in Wales playing well.""

Some experts, including former England number two Brian Moore, have been so impressed they have pencilled-in Owens as a British and Irish Lions tourist for this summer's trip to New Zealand.
Like the rest of the players, Owens sidesteps the Lions question but concedes he is more than happy with his form.
""I am pretty happy. The set-piece has gone well, and it is just nice to have a consistent run of games starting. I think that has helped me,"" he added.
""I work hard and try to take my chances when they come, and thankfully, I am playing okay at the moment.
""I am not doing a lot different to what I was doing before. Perhaps I am a lot more consistent at the moment.""
Another factor in Owens' happiness is that he has had to come back from serious neck injuries which have seen him undergo two operations and miss a good deal of rugby.
He says his latest lay-off, which sidelined him for four months in 2014, was particularly frustrating.
""Initially, I thought I would be out for six to eight weeks,"" he said.
""The neck wasn't really the problem, it was nerve damage because it was my second big impact on that part of the nerves.
""It just took forever for it to regenerate, and it is only really now that my strength is anywhere near where it should be.
""It was my third neck injury but thankfully, touch wood, there were no issues and I managed to get through it.
""I always thought I would get back, it was just a case of how long it would take for the nerves to regenerate.""
Owens has shown nerves of steel at the line-outs this season, with Wales' set-piece operating as an effective attacking tool - particularly in the 22-9 win over Ireland.
That match also saw Owens become a social media sensation thanks to his full-blooded celebration caught on camera when Jamie Roberts scored the match-clinching try.
""Maybe I went a bit over the top,"" he says.
""That score was huge. The game was won, and we knew how important the victory was to us as a squad.""

"It follows last month's announcement that Birmingham Prison is to become the first jail in the UK to be privatised.
Prison officers are banned from going on strike, but the ballot will seek the members' views about ""industrial action up to and including strike action"".
The government says contingency plans involve the police and military.
About 30,000 members of the Prison Officers' Association (POA) in England and Wales will take part in an indicative ballot, which will be considered by union leaders before they decide their next move.
POA general secretary Steve Gillan said prison officers were ""angry"" at the government's privatisation plans.
National chairman Colin Moses said: ""It is vital members have their say through the ballot box and decide what course of action they are prepared to take to support their colleagues, who have been sold off to the private sector.""
""Prisons should not be run for profit and whilst Ken Clarke took great pride in announcing the privatisation of these prisons, the POA remains of the view that it is the state's responsibility to imprison its citizens and not profiteers"".
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said its aim was to avoid ""any form of industrial action"" and it would continue to talk to unions.
""However, given the risks and complexities involved in running prisons, it is sensible and appropriate to review our contingency plans for dealing with widespread industrial action,"" he said.
""There was a previous trilateral agreement with the police and the military for the provision of support to prisons and we are currently reviewing those arrangements and working with the MoD and police to ensure that our contingency arrangements are as strong as possible.""

In March, security firm G4S was awarded the contract to run Birmingham's 1,400-inmate jail and Featherstone 2 prison, a new jail opening near Wolverhampton.
At the time, Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said the move would save money and improve performance on issues such as cutting reoffending rates.
Birmingham and Featherstone 2 were among four prisons whose management had been put out to tender.
Mr Clarke also announced Serco would continue to run Doncaster Prison, which was built by a private company, and it would become the first prison to be run on a ""payment by results"" basis, with the firm getting its full payment only if reoffending rates were reduced.
The other prison - Buckley Hall, in Rochdale - will continue to be run by HM Prison Service.
Thirteen private prisons already exist in the UK - 11 in England in Wales, and two in Scotland - but Birmingham is the first existing public sector prison to be contracted out.

"McGuigan and father Barry, the former world champion, signed Taylor to their Cyclone Promotions company when he won 2014 Commonwealth gold and turned pro.
""I thought you saw the complete article,"" said Shane McGuigan of the man from Prestonpans in East Lothian.
""He looked like he could punch - now he can really punch since changing the technique a bit.""
In addition, the trainer said he was keen to work with Taylor because ""he has a great personality, he's a good-looking lad, he's fast and he can really fight - he ticked a lot of boxes"".
He added: ""Also, I felt dad, with his background, a hall of famer, being a Celt himself, can appeal to a lot of the public in Scotland.""
Taylor left Edinburgh's Lochend club, where he worked under Terry McCormack, and now trains for his pro fights at the McGuigans' gym in Wandsworth, south London.
He is aiming for a 10th consecutive win when he defends his Commonwealth super-lightweight title against Hackney's WBC Silver champion Ohara Davies at Glasgow's Braehead Arena on 8 July.
""Josh is a phenomenal talent, a phenomenal force,"" added McGuigan junior.
""He's been pro for a short time and he's already the Commonwealth champion and within six to 10 months he will be knocking on the door of a world title.
""We've been working together for nearly two years now and he has excelled so quickly.
""He has come out of the elite level amateur system and he is still progressing.
""He has shown me so much in the gym and now it is our chance to really showcase that talent on the main stage in front of big audiences on television and at Braehead.""
Cyclone Promotions hopes Taylor will generate the same level of appeal as his stablemate, Belfast's Carl Frampton, a two-weight world champion.
""With Carl, we built him up at home and then we took him to America and then to Manchester for a unification fight,"" said Shane McGuigan.
""That's the same sort of platform we would like to set up for Josh Taylor.
""We'd like to make him a star back home in Scotland and then filter him out to London, Manchester and the bigger arenas and then eventually go to the States. That is where he is inevitably going to end up, that's where the money is.
""It is very rare that you have the Errol Spencers coming to fight for world titles over here. If you build loyalty with your fans they will go anywhere.""
The McGuigans have already had Taylor on the road, with three of his nine fights being in El Paso, New York and Las Vegas.
""The American public loved his crowd-pleasing style, just like they loved Ricky Hatton,"" said the trainer.
""People want to see a good fighter go to work and they will get that with Josh Taylor.""
Shane McGuigan is anticipating a ""tricky"" fight against undefeated Davies next month, expecting it to go to the later rounds.

"Early indications are of wide variations nationwide, with up to one in six missing out on their first choice of school in some areas.
While in other areas, almost all got their number one preference.
It comes days after council leaders said two in five local authorities would have too few places by 2016.
Pressure is growing, particularly in schools on London's fringes and in cities such as Leicester, Nottingham, Reading and Peterborough.
However, in London, around 99,000 pupils or 95% received a place at one of their six preferred schools this year - up 1,100 and nearly five percentage points from last year.
Of those, 81% got into their first preference school, the same proportion as the two previous years. But there were wide local variations within the capital. In Kensington and Chelsea, only 59% got their first preference, while in Barking and Dagenham it was 91%.
This comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year.
The crisis has been precipitated mainly by a booming birth-rate, partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools.
The demand for school places has risen steeply in Harrow, which has some very good primary schools. It was predicted to be 12% over capacity by this September but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for Harrow children this year.
A spokesman said the crush Harrow was seeing now was very likely to affect other areas around the country soon.
Initial results from a Press Association survey of town halls shows families in some areas are more likely to gain a place at their top choice than in others.
Results from Birmingham show 84.7% of children starting reception have got a place at their first preference, while 94.8% got one of their listed choices. Around one in 20 applicants - 826 children - were given a school that was not one of their preferred options. A further 3.3% - 532 youngsters - have been offered a school outside the city.
Figures from East Sussex show 84.68% got their first choice, while in Southampton the percentage was 85.4%.
In Derbyshire, 93.4% of youngsters received their first pick, in Torbay it was 86.2%, Bristol was 84% - up from 82% last year, and in Cornwall it was 90.7%.
In Kent the figure was was 85.81%, up slightly from 84.9% last year.
Labour and the National Association of Head Teachers also blame the coalition government's free-school policy, which has allowed some new schools to be opened in areas that already have surplus places.
At the same time, the ability of local authorities to plan for population surges has been reduced by regulations requiring any new schools to be either an academy or a free school, rather than a council school.
NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: ""We have a balkanised system with authorities, academies and central government taking decisions in isolation.""
He added: ""There is a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors. With the massive increase in pupil numbers and over-stretched budgets, we cannot afford inefficiency and conflict.""
The Local Government Association said the escalating places shortage was one of the key areas that needed to be tackled by the next government.
Earlier this month, it said schools were ""reaching their limits and could soon run out of space and money for extra places"" and there would be a need for an extra 880,000 pupils at a cost of Â£12bn.
The Conservatives blame Labour for the problem saying the party ""cut over 200,000 primary school places - and even ignored official warnings to provide extra school places after a baby boom"".
A spokesman added: ""The Conservatives have created over 400,000 school places. There are fewer children in overcrowded primary schools and, most importantly, one million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.""
Labour points out that under the Conservative-Lib Dem administration the number of infant children in classes with more than 30 pupils has more than trebled from 31,265 in 2010 to 102,615 in 2015.
Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt blamed the Conservatives for spending ""hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on a few free schools in areas where there are no shortages of places"".
But Natalie Evans, director of New Schools Network, said: ""Over 90% of primary free schools opened or approved to open are in areas where new school places are needed. But they are also offering new choices in areas of low standards.""
Liberal Democrat schools minister David Laws said: ""It's astonishing that Labour and the Conservatives won't properly fund these children.  It will be impossible to provide a place for every child and raise standards unless we protect education budgets.""
Ty Goddard, co-founder of think-tank Education Foundation, said England's vast education property estate could be used with more imagination, but called for the parties to work together on solving the school places issue.

"It decided to reorganise the way patients were diagnosed by GPs and specialists by bringing in a new approach, especially to deal with those cancer cases which are not initially obvious.
A team of cancer specialists, GPs, NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact-finding visit to Aarhus, Denmark's second city.
So what was the problem?
Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed ""quite alarming"" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries, including the rest of Scandinavia.
Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long.
It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms. They could be fast-tracked to specialists in hospital.
It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out.
""We looked at 30,000 cancer cases - and more than 25% of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn't think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it's important to find those cases,"" said Prof Olesen.
What were the changes?
The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes.
First -  for patients with "" alarm"" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast-track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets.
In addition to that, by law, any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral.
Second, the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs cannot diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them, whether it is cancer or something else.
GP Dr Hanne Heje, who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer.
It also stops the ""ping pong"" between GPs and different specialists.
""Now we know there's a department meeting the patient with open arms saying 'we welcome you', even though there's not a diagnosis written on their forehead,"" she said.
The third route deals with the group of patients with minor symptoms, which are very unlikely to be cancer but in rare cases could be.
These patients go to so-called ""yes-no"" centres which offer a simple test or scan so they can be seen quickly and any problems identified.
""This can be solved within hours in some cases but 1% will have a serious disease and this can be detected,"" said Prof Olesen.
""For these patients before - they might have had to wait four to six months, so for the small percentage where something is found, they'd start treatment six months behind the time schedule.""
The results so far
Prof Olesen - a former GP himself - said the changes have not led to a ""flooding of the system"" by more GP referrals but better organisation of how patients are diagnosed within existing resources.
Importantly, he says it has also led to better survival rates.
""We've got very optimistic results showing Norway, Sweden and Finland are becoming better year by year,"" he said. ""But very clearly in the data Denmark is becoming better, a faster pace than before and catching up and getting closer to where we should be.""
Denmark has a similar health system in how it is funded and organised to Wales.
He said there could be lessons shared between Wales and Denmark on how better organisation can help ""in catching up the elite in Europe"".
Dr Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he had been impressed with how the Danish health service had broken down the barriers between GPs and specialists to work better together.
He said: ""People are not just doing tests in isolation - they are working together to achieve a diagnosis.""",Denmark's health service - which is similar to the NHS -  started to look in depth at the problem of cancer survival rates in 2000.,35998182
"Residents living around the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield have said cars are being illegally parked on local streets by staff and patients.

"Lenin Moreno, of the governing left-wing Pais party, fell just short of the 40% needed to win outright on Sunday.
He will fight former banker Guillermo Lasso for the top job. There had been tension after long delays in the count.
National Electoral Council President Juan Pablo Pozo blamed the delays on ""numerical inconsistencies"" in 5.5% of the ballots.
In past elections, official results were announced on the same night as the vote but this time counting dragged on for four days.
Final results are still not in, but with only half a percent of votes left to count, Mr Moreno, 63, cannot possibly reach the 40% needed to stave off a second round.
With 99.5% of the votes counted he had won 39.3% of the votes, against 28.1% for Mr Lasso.
Lenin Moreno:
Guillermo Lasso:
The announcement that there would be a second round was celebrated by supporters of Mr Lasso, 61, gathered outside the National Electoral Council building.
Mr Lasso had earlier voiced concerns about the delay in counting saying it ""did not smell right"".
The conservative former banker says he is confident of winning the run-off with the backing of opposition candidates eliminated in the first round.
Third-placed Cynthia Viteri, who won more than 16% of the votes, has already called on her supporters to vote for Mr Lasso.
The election is being watched with interest in the region after other countries led by left-wing leaders, such as Argentina and Peru, have swung to the right in recent polls.
The winner will replace left-wing President Rafael Correa, who leaves office after a decade in power.","Ecuador's presidential election is set for a second round on 2 April, the electoral commission has announced.",39063683
"The announcement came during a trade mission to China involving business leaders from across Scotland.
SCC said a recent Chinese policy of opening up to new overseas alliances presented ""a myriad of opportunities"" for Scottish businesses.
It added there was potential to sell goods and services which Chinese firms and consumers wanted and needed.
The trade mission saw SCC hold meetings with senior business people, politicians and local government officials, as well as ""think tanks"" in Beijing, Yantai and Jinan in the eastern province of Shandong.
The Scottish delegation was led by SCC's new president, Tim Allan, and chief executive Liz Cameron.
During the visit, SCC signed a memorandum of understanding for ""trade engagement and partnership"" with senior officials from the Yantai municipal government.
Ms Cameron said: ""This exploratory visit is part of the new partnership which was formed between Scottish business, through our extensive chamber network, and the Scottish government to utilise the worldwide connectivity of the business community.
""We now have a deeper understanding of how we can achieve the best exchange for business, where the opportunities exist for Scottish organisations and how we can best pursue these.
""We have also identified several potential opportunities for inward investment into Scotland and will be working with Scottish government and SDI as well as other trade organisations to explore these and leverage the momentum of change within China.""
She added: ""Our next steps will be to undertake a deep-dive of companies based in Scotland who have products, skills and expertise which have the potential to be exported to the Shandong Province area.
""Our aim is to add impetus to the Scottish economy by assisting companies who have not previously thought about exporting to grasp the potential that international trade offers.""
According to SCC, Shandong Province represents the third largest economy in China, with a population of nearly 100 million.
Key sectors it has identified as being of interest to Scottish businesses include robotics, bioscience, manufacturing, engineering and smart technologies, agriculture, food and drink and football management.
SCC said there were also opportunities in consumer goods, recreation and tourism services, financial and professional services and education.
SCC intends to return to the province later this year to ""explore new ways to foster co-operation between the two countries"".","Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) has officially opened a new international trade office in Yantai, China.",39928446
"They introduced it 10 years ago when the West African country was suffering from a shortfall of nurses as many headed off for better opportunities in the West.
It began a scheme funding the education of nurses who then had to agree to work for the next five years in Ghana.
But now the government says it has enough nurses and it is no longer useful to keep them under bond.
""There are now more private schools churning out nurses and some of them can't even find jobs,"" Dr Kwesi Abir, the health ministry's deputy director of human resources, told the BBC.
""There is no point to continue to pay the tuition of nurses and also give allowances when hundreds are paying their own fees in private schools,"" he said.
The policy reversal is unlikely to lead to an immediate exodus of nurses because although the bond scheme stopped taking new entrants last year, it takes four years to qualify as a nurse and those already in the scheme will have to finish their five-year service.
If a nurse wants to jump the bond there is penalty of $650 (Â£422) to pay for each uncompleted year, something very few can afford to do.
And the authorities will not issue certificates that will enable them to work abroad unless the fine is paid.
Student nurse Collins Aboagye says he is in that position - even though he would love to work in the UK after qualifying, he will not be able to.
""I think the five years is too muchâ€¦ I wish to work outside because outside, there are certain things their way of delivering care is a bit different from ours here.""
This is a sentiment - a desire for job satisfaction - that is echoed at the country's premiere hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital, Accra.
Nurses can be seen under pressure as they attend to patients in the maternity ward - a large hall with about 100 benches filled with women awaiting for antenatal services.
Some of them are impatient, demanding to be seen more quickly.
One of the major difficulties in providing good healthcare is not just the number of healthcare professionals but the fact that hospitals are ill equipped, nurses told the BBC.
They say there are insufficient protective plastic gloves, not enough hospital beds for patients, a lack of water and chemicals, frequent power outages - their list is endless.
However, salaries are likely to still be a driving factor for nurses to go abroad given Ghana's rising cost of living.
According to the UK's National Health Service, a newly qualified nurse starts on a salary of more than Â£21,000 a year - with opportunities to earn overtime - that is, at least $2,695 a month.
A professional nurse in Ghana earns about $400 a month after tax  - and nurses often face the frustration of delays in the payment  of their salaries.
Salma Razak, a nurse at Korle Bu who just finished serving her bond, is free now to work abroad, but she remains undecided.
She says although the government has improved some things for nurses, much more could be done.
""From the beginning, you can start by paying us hourly, not monthly - in that way salaries will be much more,"" she told the BBC.
This would stop nurses being tempted to seek employment elsewhere, she said.
Ghana currently has a little more than 20,000 professional nurses.
Each year about 400 enter the job market but in 2004 almost twice that number - 700 nurses - left to work in the UK.
Ghana's health ministry says these numbers have dramatically declined with only about 300 nurses leaving in the last two years.
Behind the numbers, there are grave concerns about the quality of healthcare delivery.
And there is a down side for students from poorer backgrounds who will no longer be able to benefit from the  government-funded scheme.
But with the brain drain stemmed, health officials are optimistic that the funds used in nurse training can now be used to address long waiting hours and improve hospitals.",Ghana's government has scrapped a controversial ban on newly qualified nurses travelling to find more lucrative employment abroad.,31637774
"Turkey has reacted with anger to the comment made by the Pope at a service in Rome earlier on Sunday.
Armenia and many historians say up to 1.5 million Armenian Christians were killed by Ottoman forces in 1915.
But Turkey has always disputed that figure and said the deaths were part of a civil conflict triggered by WW1.
The row has continued to sour relations between Armenia and Turkey.
The Pope made the comments at a Mass in the Armenian Catholic rite at Peter's Basilica, attended by the Armenian president and church leaders.
He said that humanity had lived through ""three massive and unprecedented tragedies"" in the last century.
""The first, which is widely considered 'the first genocide of the 20th Century', struck your own Armenian people,"" he said, in a form of words used by a declaration by Pope John Paul II in 2001.
Pope Francis also referred to the crimes ""perpetrated by Nazism and Stalinism"" and said other genocides had followed in Cambodia, Rwanda, Burundi and Bosnia.
He said it was his duty to honour the memories of those who were killed.
""Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it,"" the Pope added.
Armenia's President Serzh Sargsyan welcomed his comments, saying they sent a powerful message to the international community.
But Turkey immediately summoned the Vatican's ambassador to Ankara for an explanation, and then later recalled its ambassador from Rome.
The foreign ministry said it felt ""great disappointment and sadness"" at the Pope's remarks, which it said would cause a ""problem of trust"" between them.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted: ""The Pope's statement, which is far from the legal and historical reality, cannot be accepted.
""Religious authorities are not the places to incite resentment and hatred with baseless allegations,"" he added.
Pope Francis, who visited Turkey last year, would have been perfectly conscious that he would offend the moderate Muslim country by his use of the word ""genocide"".
But the Pope's powerful phrase ""concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to bleed without bandaging it"" extended his condemnation to all other, more recent, mass killings.
It now remains to be seen how far his remarks will impact upon the Vatican's future relations with moderate Muslim states. It was a bold decision but totally coherent with Pope Francis' philosophy of open discussion about moral arguments.
Pope Francis' focus today on Armenia, the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion, even before the conversion of the Roman Emperor Constantine, serves as yet another reminder of the Catholic Church's widely spread roots in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
In 2014, for the first time, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences to the grandchildren of all the Armenians who lost their lives.
But he also said that it was inadmissible for Armenia to turn the issue ""into a matter of political conflict"".
Armenia says up to 1.5 million people died in 1915-16 as the Ottoman Empire was disintegrating. Turkey has said the number of deaths was much smaller.
Many of the victims were civilians deported en masse to barren desert regions where they died of starvation and thirst. Thousands also died in massacres.
Most non-Turkish scholars of the events regard them as genocide. Among the other states which formally recognise them as genocide are Argentina, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Russia and Uruguay.
Turkey maintains that many of the dead were killed in clashes during World War One, and that ethnic Turks also suffered in the conflict.","Turkey has recalled its envoy to the Vatican after Pope Francis described the mass killing of Armenians under Ottoman rule in WW1 as ""genocide"".",32272604
"Jack Walsh, from Lisburn in County Antrim, is hoping he will be one of the few to make it big.
""Here everyone is involved in the industry as an actor or film-maker, even if they're serving coffee in a restaurant,"" he said.
His passion for film was initially sparked by his A-level course in moving image arts at Friends' School in Lisburn.
Now, the 23-year-old is working for the hugely popular Game Grumps channel in Los Angeles, which has over 3.1m YouTube subscribers.
The idea is deceptively simple.
Each day, Game Grumps uploads up to four videos of members of the group playing a videogame while talking about it as they play.
Be warned, the commentary and humour can be of the adults-only variety.
But watching and listening to members of the company play classic videogames like Super Mario attracts hundreds of thousands of people a day.
Walsh works behind the camera to help keep the whole enterprise going.
""You'd be amazed at the work that goes into watching people play video games,"" he said.
""What I do is shooting and directing the commercials for them which they upload onto their channel.
""They get asked by a lot of technological and computer companies to promote and advertise their products, so I film live action material for them.""
He is also involved in the company's planned expansion into TV comedy on YouTube's Red channel, which has recently been launched as an alternative to Netflix.
""We're developing more original material which will be released on YouTube,"" he said.
""The team behind Game Grumps are animators, comedians and musicians, so the YouTube channel helps to keep all their other projects afloat.
""We hope to get bigger, releasing more original content.""
Walsh moved to Los Angeles at 18 to study at film school straight after taking four A-levels at Friends' School.
His A-level in moving image arts got him hooked on filmmaking, and in the final year of his film degree he got an opportunity to work with leading composer John Debney.
Debney has composed scores for a number of films including Iron Man 2, Bruce Almighty, Elf and The Passion Of The Christ, for which he was nominated for an Oscar.
""Our syllabus allowed us to intern at a production company for the final semester and I was fortunate enough to work with him,"" said Walsh.
""I was his sole intern and at the time John was conducting for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, released last year as the first film under Paramount's new animation studio.""
That experience led Walsh to write and direct his own short film musical, Not Another High School Musical, in which a teenage boy becomes inspired to form his own all-singing, dancing gang to stand up to the bullies in his school after watching West Side Story.
""I wrote the music and lyrics, and I would really like to do more of that in the future,"" he said.
""I hope to write a Game Grumps musical and shoot it over the next couple of years.""
And would he like to return home to work in Northern Ireland's burgeoning film industry at some point?
""It's great that the film industry is growing in Northern Ireland, especially with Game Of Thrones, which is really the biggest TV show in the world,"" he said.
""I still think there are more opportunities back home as well.
""LA can be lonely if you don't know anyone, but the company here is getting bigger and bigger and I want to shoot and direct more so I'm not ready to come home just yet.""","It is the home of the entertainment universe, but for every top filmmaker in Los Angeles there are many who fail to be successful.",35771740
"The plans resolve a concussion lawsuit filed against the federation by parents but US Soccer said it had planned to introduce a new safety campaign.
They also intend to limit the amount of heading in practice for children between the ages of 11 and 13.
""Although these are recommendations, they are based on the advice of the US Soccer medical committee,"" it said.
""Therefore US Soccer strongly urges that they be followed.""
The lawsuit filed by young players and their parents in August 2014 accused governing bodies, including Fifa and the California Youth Soccer Association, of acting ""carelessly and negligently"" and failing to protect young players.
US Soccer said the reforms would also include ""modifications to substitution rules in relation to concussions"" and would be ""requirements for players that are part of US Soccer's youth national teams and the development academy.""
It added: ""Protecting the health and safety of athletes and preventing injuries is critically important to US Soccer.""
There has been previous criticism of football's attitude towards concussions but new rules have been brought in for Premier League matches after Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris continued playing after he lost consciousness.
Following those measures Dr Michael Grey, a leading neuroscientist from the University of Birmingham, said it was dangerous for children to head a football.
The Football Association offer no specific guidance for children heading footballs in England but said it had ""noted the new rule changes outlined by US Soccer and will closely monitor any available new research in this area"".
The FA also said it would shortly announce new guidelines formed by an independent expert panel ""which look at how to identify, manage and treat suspected head injuries and to manage a player's safe return to play at all levels of football"".
It added: ""However, they do not relate to how football should be played - something which is governed by the laws of the game set out by Fifa as the world's governing body.
""In addition to this new guidance, the panel has been tasked to identify key research questions into the long-term effects of head injury or repeated concussion episodes on the brain. The FA will take these research questions to Fifa in due course.""",The United States Soccer Federation has outlined plans to stop children aged 10 and under heading footballs.,34780549

"John ""Jack"" Zawadski, 82, and his nephew filed the lawsuit after being told that the funeral parlour did not ""deal with their kind"".
Their legal team argue the response of staff at the Picayune mortuary devastated Mr Zawadski and his family.
But the co-owner of the funeral home has tearfully denied the allegations.
""We just didn't do that,"" a weeping Henrietta Brewer told Mississippi Today.
Mrs Brewer said that her mortuary had handled the funerals of ""well over a dozen"" gay people since she and her husband opened it in 2006.
She said one gay man had even been buried in the funeral home's privately-owned cemetery.
""We're the ones that treat everyone good,"" Mrs Brewer said, arguing that none of her staff was homophobic.
'Bob was my life'
Mr Zawadski and his nephew, John Gaspari, are seeking unspecified cash compensation from the Brewer Funeral Home for ""breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress"", Lambda Legal said in a press statement.
The lawsuit says that Mr Gaspari had completed all the arrangements for the funeral of his uncle, Robert Huskey, who died in a hospice shortly after celebrating his 86th birthday.
They argue that the funeral parlour suddenly declined the use of their facilities - including the storage and transport of Mr Huskey's body - after they found out he was married to a man.
Mr Zawadski said that the alleged action of the funeral home left him feeling as ""if the air had been knocked"" out of him.
""Bob was my life, and we had always felt so welcome in this community. And then, at a moment of such personal pain and loss, to have someone do what they did to me, to us, to Bob, I just couldn't believe it. No-one should be put through what we were put through.""
Lambda Legal Counsel Beth Littrell said that what had happened to them was  shocking.
""Almost immediately after losing his husband and partner of more than 50 years, Jack Zawadski's grief was compounded by injustice and callous treatment from the very place that should have helped ease his suffering,"" she said.

"Reuben Lewis from Llanidloes was driven 45 minutes from Ysgol Cedewain, Newtown, without teachers or transport staff realising he was still on board.
BBC Wales understands he was then left alone on the parked bus in Rhayader on two separate occasions.
Powys council said there had been a ""serious breakdown in communication"".
A spokesman added it had spoken to the school and all contractors to ensure immediate safeguards were put in place to prevent any similar incidents in future.
The most recent incident was on Monday, when it was only noticed Reuben was missing after his sister spotted he was not present at a school swimming lesson she was teaching at Maldwyn Leisure Centre in Newtown.
Police were told and Reuben was found at the Simon Price Cars bus depot.
Reuben's father, Rob Lewis, said there had been ""several mistakes"" by the school and transport provider in the past year.
He said Reuben was left on the bus in May last year and left at school the following December.
""I was in total and utter shock that this had happened again,"" he said.
""I'm always happy to give someone a second chance, but now I wish I'd never given them a first chance. This beggars belief.
""It was sheer luck that it was noticed Reuben was missing on Monday because his older sister works part time as a lifeguard in the leisure centre.
""She knew her brother was meant to be at the swimming lessons and when she couldn't see him she rang her mother and we alerted the school and the police.""
Mr Lewis said he had an agreement with the school to notify them before 09:00 if Reuben would not be attending, so the alarm would be raised if he was not there.
""So how could this happen again on Monday, after we were given so many reassurances?"" he added.
Simon Price, owner of Simon Price Cars, said the company was contractually unable to comment while the investigation was ongoing.

""Houthi gunmen were attacking Saudi border positions from this area but the coalition's planes failed to hit the fighters and bombed civilians [instead],"" one resident alleged.
Hours after the air strikes in Hajjah, coalition warplanes targeted the headquarters of the Special Security Forces in the southern Sabaain district of Sanaa.
Officials from the rebel-controlled health ministry said that 36 soldiers and officers had been killed. However, a commando who survived the attack suggested that civilians might also have been among the victims.
""There were many people at the entrance to the warehouse, getting their weapons, farmers, cooks [and also soldiers]; these poor people were standing at the entrance to the warehouse,"" he told Reuters.

"This is the full statement to the inquests read by his son, Stephen Clark, on behalf of his mother Jacqueline Gilchrist:
Jacqueline Gilchrist speaking on behalf of the Clark family.
Joseph Clark came from a large family. He had five brothers and one sister. He was the third eldest and always loved spending time with his extended family when he was growing up.
'Oey' was quite a shy lad who enjoyed playing football and going out with his mates and brothers. He was very close to his siblings, as well as his Mum and Dad.
Profiles of all those who died
He loved it when his extended family had large gatherings. He got to meet those relatives he hadn't seen for a while. Even his aunts and uncles loved him.
Joseph, who was also known as Oey, played football for two local teams and was known for being a speedy winger. One of the teams he played for was the Woodpecker Bar FC.  People always commented on how good a player he was, even if he was just kicking a ball about with his mates.
Oey and I met in 1978. I was 16 years old and Oey was 18. We lived around the corner from each other.
'Fell in love'
We met in a club and from then fell in love. We loved each other to bits, and then, four and a half years after we met, we had our first son Joseph, who was born on 31 August, 1982.
Sadly, we lost Joseph on 15 October when he was just six-and-a-half weeks old. Oey was heartbroken.
Stephen was born two years later, on 22 March, 1984. Oey was over the moon and was so excited that he had a son. He nicknamed him BB. They were always playing football together and going on days out on boats up the Mersey.
In 1989, we gave birth to a little girl Jennifer. She was tiny. Oey was scared to pick her up.
The morning of 15 April, 1989, that horrible day, was one of the times that he did pick her up before he left the house. He had been playing football with Stephen outside while holding Jennifer in his arms and swinging her in the air.
His mates arrived in the car to go to the match, so he gave us all a kiss and said 'See you later' and off he went. That was the last thing that he said to us because he never came back from the match.
He was only 29 years old with his whole life in front of him.
'Happy-go-lucky'
Oey was employed by IBL in Liverpool and enjoyed his time working there.
We all miss Oey very, very much. Life has never been the same since he died that horrible day. Our whole lives changed and I never really got over it and we're in still life. I am still the same from that day.
Oey would have been proud of his children now that they are grown up. Stephen remembers lots about him, going to matches with his father and enjoying the time  that they spent together.
He loved Liverpool Football Club and I know that he was very proud to be able to take his own son to the matches at Anfield.
Oey has three beautiful grandchildren, who he never had the chance to meet. The eldest, Joseph, was born on New Year's Eve ,2005. Lee was born in 2008 and his  grand-daughter, Daisy, was born on 27 July, 2012 but unfortunately Daisy only lived 12 days before she passed away.
Joseph loved life to the full. He was always happy-go-lucky and forever with a smile on his face. He is missed by all of us who were lucky enough to have known him.","A father-of-two from Liverpool, Joseph Clark was a fork lift driver and drove to the match with his brother Stephen Clark and David Roberts, who both survived, and another friend, Alan McGlone, who also died in the tragedy.",26981620
"The former police captain ran a covert counter-insurgency unit that detained and killed anti-apartheid activists.
Â­It operated in secrecy from Vlakplaas, a farm near Pretoria, recruiting black liberation movement members whom it turned into killers.
He revealed the existence of Vlakplaas in 1989 when he was smuggled out of South Africa to write his story.
Coetzee claimed responsibility for the killings of several African National Congress (ANC) members.
He took refuge in London after exposing the group in an interview with a liberal Afrikaans newspaper.
Once he was in exile, he joined the ANC, where he was known as Comrade Dirk with allegiance to Nelson Mandela, and himself became an assassination target for the white-minority government.
He later returned to South Africa and joined the post-apartheid spy service after Mr Mandela became president in 1994.
He was later convicted of murder, but granted amnesty by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997 when he publicly confessed to murdering a Durban human rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge.
However, Coetzee failed to reveal the place where another activist, Sizwe Kondile, had been buried after being killed and burnt.

Volunteers from the Poland Street association are in attendance; about 100 people have turned up to sweep away leaves and light candles contained in glass lanterns, or znicze.
""This beautiful way of remembering those who have passed away takes on a new symbolic meaning abroad,"" says the association's spokeswoman, Anna Galandzij.
""It brings together older and younger generations of Polish expats, which is much needed now the UK has voted to leave the EU.""
She adds: ""The UK has been home to many generations of Poles, including the Polish Government in Exile, pilots who fought in the Battle of Britain, and soldiers of the Polish Home Army, who couldn't go back to Poland after the Second World War.
""Every candle we light on their graves is a tribute to what they did.""
The president of the Polish Government in Exile, Kazimierz Sabbat, is among those buried at Gunnersbury and his daughters are present to see the clean-up.
Jolanta Sabbat and Anna Swidlicka say they are moved by the actions of Poland Street volunteers and the Polish Scouts who have given up their time.
""Attending to the graves reminds us of our roots,"" Anna says.
When her father understood that Communism would last in Poland and could not go back because he had served with Polish troops based in Scotland, ""he taught us to respect the country we were in but also to remember our Polish heritage"".

Last month, the government said it would give the immigration minister the power to revoke citizenship in regards to terrorism activities but that option was attacked as unconstitutional by many legal experts.
Mr Abbott said on Monday the new laws would not leave anyone stateless and did not exclude the role of the courts.
""This will enable a person who has lost his or her citizenship to seek legal redress,"" Mr Abbott said.
""If you are convicted of a terrorist offence, again, there will be an assumption that your Australian citizenship is forfeited, should you be a dual national.""
Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security will examine whether the law should be allowed to operate retrospectively.
""Given that we have a number of dual citizens currently in jail after terrorist convictions, the committee should consider whether it should have retrospective operation at least in those cases,"" said Mr Abbott.
He said another review would consider what to do with people engaged in terrorism who were solely Australian nationals.",Australia says it will reveal new laws stripping citizenship from dual nationals engaged in terrorism.,33234825
"Infrastructure minister Keith Brown has confirmed that officers have discussed a feasibility study on linking the rail line with Carlisle, through Hawick.
News of the discussions emerged in response to a parliamentary question tabled by MSP Jim Hume.
The new 30-mile Borders Railway is expected to open in September.
In answer to Mr Hume's question, Mr Brown said the government had played an active part in taking forward the Borders Railway Blueprint for the Future.
He added: ""Transport Scotland officials have already met with partners and offered initial advice on a scoping document which will explore the possibility of extending the Borders railway towards Hawick and Carlisle.""
The announcement was welcomed by the Lib Dem MSP for the south of Scotland.
Mr Hume said: ""I have no doubt that such a project would greatly benefit communities not just in the Borders but also in Dumfriesshire, and would draw even further on the already clear tourism opportunities from the line reaching Tweedbank.
""Local campaigners such as the Campaign for Borders Rail have kept the focus on this issue and this positive response from the Scottish government must now be the building blocks for progress on an extended rail link.

"Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside Wildlife Trust said the skins of insects have been found on Winmarleigh Moss, near Garstang.
The baculovirus drives caterpillars on a ""death march"" to the top of plants, then when it dies the bug bursts out to seek other victims.
The trust's Dr Chris Miller said it was ""gruesome - like a zombie horror film"".
Dr Miller was carrying out a butterfly survey on Winmarleigh Moss when he noticed a caterpillar hanging from the end of a branch of a small bush.
He then saw another one hanging from a tall blade of grass.
""Both were dead but otherwise intact,"" he said.
Dr Miller also noticed ""small scraps of caterpillar skin"" on other branches he checked.
He said research is showing that the baculovirus affects the way the ""zombie"" insects respond to light, ""making them climb to higher and more dangerous places and when they get there they die"".
""It is really unusual seeing caterpillars high up as they can be eaten by birds.

"Those with mental health or neurological conditions were least likely to have developed ways of living with their illness.
A study of 15,687 adults has been analysed at Heriot-Watt University.
The Welsh government said it was working with charities on a patient guide for those with chronic illnesses.
The study, published in the International Journal of Cardiology and based on research in 2012, found:
Chronic illnesses affect an estimated 800,000 people in Wales and are a growing problem for the NHS as the population gets older.
Dr Ivy Shiue, assistant professor of environmental health at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, said people who had not learnt to live with symptoms experienced worse quality of life and the risks were especially high for those with mental health conditions.
""These patients may start to lose hope and their sense of identity, ultimately leading to a feeling of fear, hopelessness and despair at their condition,"" she said.

"Prime Minister David Cameron announced the deal as he started a Jamaica visit.
The project has been agreed to break the deadlock in negotiations over a prisoner transfer deal between the two countries.
More than 600 Jamaican nationals are in UK jails but cannot be deported because of Jamaica's poor prison conditions.
Officials say the foreign aid-funded deal could save taxpayers £10m a year when transfers begin in 2020.
More than 300 existing offenders are expected to be sent back under the Jamaica prison scheme, which covers those sentenced to at least four years who have 18 months or more left to serve in custody.
Currently they cannot be sent to Jamaica because of fears that jail conditions in the country would allow a successful challenge under human rights law.
Jamaica is third highest in the list of foreign countries with nationals serving prison sentences in the UK..
Almost 70% of the Jamaicans in prison in Britain are serving sentences for violence and drug offences.
The UK is contributing about 40% of the cost of building the planned jail, which would hold 1,500 people.
Mr Cameron, who had been at the United Nations in New York for talks on the fight against the Islamic State group, said: ""It is absolutely right that foreign criminals who break our laws are properly punished but this shouldn't be at the expense of the hard-working British taxpayer,"" he said.
""That's why this agreement is so important. It will mean Jamaican criminals are sent back home to serve their sentences, saving the British guard of honourtaxpayer millions of pounds but still ensuring justice is done.
""And it will help Jamaica by helping to provide a new prison, strengthening their criminal justice system.""
Mr Cameron, the first British prime minister to visit the island in 14 years, is also set to announce £300m of aid funding on infrastructure projects across the Caribbean, including roads, bridges and ports.
He said the regional infrastructure fund, which will be delivered in collaboration with the Caribbean Development Bank, would help support economic growth in the Caribbean.
Mr Cameron was greeted on his arrival at Kingston Airport by an honour guard and national anthems before he visited RFA Lyme Bay, the British ship currently on anti-drug smuggling and emergency relief duties in the Caribbean.
He is due to finish the day by having talks with Jamaican Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and attending a reception.

"The 58-year-old, who drew his first game in management with Bournemouth in 1992 on a plastic pitch at Preston, admits that a return to Stoke ""could not have been scripted better"".
""Players live a different life now,"" he said. ""In a world where they get everything, they've become film stars.""
Pulis managed the Potters for 464 matches over two spells and comes up against his old side with them bottom of the early Premier League table.
But the Welshman - who has also managed Crystal Palace in the Premier League - expects current Stoke boss Mark Hughes to steer his side away from trouble.
""You couldn't have scripted it better to be honest, the fact that I'm going back to Stoke,"" Pulis said.
""It's fantastic. Whichever way the result goes, my 1,000th game will be at Stoke and I had great times there.
""Everything changes so quickly. A couple of games and Stoke could be two-thirds of the way up the table. What you've got to do, and I don't have to tell Mark how to manage, is to keep your feet on the ground. Keep looking ahead, keep pointing ahead and hope that things change.
""They have a very strong squad there and it's a surprise that they are down at the bottom. I'm sure they will get out of it - I just hope that it's not on Saturday that they start.""
Pulis first took charge of Bournemouth in the third tier of English football in August 1992, as the first Premier League season got under way.
His big signing that summer was striker Steve Fletcher for £30,000. This summer he broke West Brom's transfer record to spend £13m on Nacer Chadli.
He has been in charge for 277 Premier League games, 282 in the second tier, 258 in the third and 46 in the fourth.
Pulis has also won games in the FA Cup, League Cup, Football League Trophy and the Europa League.
""I could sit here all afternoon and talk about what has changed,"" Pulis said.
""Human beings have changed, the world has changed. Professional football, especially the Premier League, is no reflection on real life to me now.
""I would never have changed apprentices coming in and doing apprenticeships and realising how fortunate they are, even to be apprentices, never mind make the professional grade. But we can't change life - you have to move with the times.
""Everybody wants change now. If you don't like a programme straight away you can turn it over. Years ago we had ITV and BBC and that was it. You were stuck with it. Today there are a million channels.

"On 30 October 1974, a fight for the world heavyweight championship took place between George Foreman and Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire.
The bout between the then undefeated world heavyweight champion, Foreman, and his charismatic challenger, Ali, came to be known as ""The Rumble in the Jungle"". It is often called one of the greatest sporting events of the 20th Century.
Ali eventually triumphed, knocking Foreman down in the eighth round and reclaiming the title from his significantly younger opponent.
To mark the anniversary of Ali's death last year at the age of 74, photographer Hugh Kinsella Cunningham visited Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire was renamed in 1997) to meet some of the boxers hoping to follow in Ali's footsteps.
The fight was held in the Stade Tata Raphael. Although still surrounded by huge floodlights, it is in a state of disrepair, with only a few of the bulbs remaining.
The stadium is home to a boxing club named in Ali's honour and the next generation of Congolese boxers still hold him in high regard.
There are about 120 semi-regular attendees, including more than 40 who hope to box professionally. Sparring often takes place outside the stadium.
Jorbelle Malewu sits outside the Muhammad Ali Memorial Club, where she has been training since 2010.
Mainly inspired by Mike Tyson, she hopes to go on to box full-time as a professional. At present, she is unemployed.
Another boxer at the club, Dina Yame, practises outside. For him, Ali is an icon. He complains that the government provides no money for the upkeep of the Stade facilities.
There is a shortage of equipment, particularly gloves, and there is no boxing ring so sparring takes place freely around the compound.
However, at fights spectators still sit in the same stands where roughly 60,000 people gathered to watch Ali defeat Foreman.
Dorcas Lukamba has been boxing at the club for only three months, but she is aware of Ali's skill, having seen footage of his fights on DVD.
Her coach, Carlos Kabongo, sits in his office underneath the stadium. Kabongo is a former boxing champion with three gold medals, who modelled his technique on the quick-footed fighting style of ""The Greatest"".
He agrees with Yame about the lack of funding and dislikes the fact that he must charge youngsters a small fee to train within the stadium's historic premises.
Now the director of the state-run television station, RTNC, Pierre Celeste Kabala was a 27-year-old radio journalist at the time of the fight.
He remembers an atmosphere of pure elation in the city in anticipation of the American boxers' arrival.
He too bemoans the lack of support structures and funding for today's Congolese boxers.
The abandoned palace of the country's former leader, Mobutu Sese Seko, stands in Nsele, east of Kinshasa. Ali and Foreman spent much of their summer training here, becoming acclimatised to the tropical weather.
The area is now overgrown and a glaring contrast with the nearby villages.
The ruins are guarded by a handful of troops, but there is little of worth left to protect.",Photographs by Hugh Kinsella Cunningham.,40105573

Compatriot Patrick Reed and Germany's Martin Kaymer are second on five under.
England's Andy Sullivan is four under, one ahead of compatriot Justin Rose, while Rory McIlroy carded a 69.

Phil, you made a beautiful read and putt on that last hole, but got absolutely stone-cold robbed.
Nine players had carded 63s in 144 previous Opens, the last being McIlroy at St Andrews in 2010. But Mickelson's round was the lowest in an Open at Troon.

World number one Jason Day failed to capitalise on the more forgiving front nine and after eight pars on the homeward nine bogeyed the last to finish two over.
Pre-tournament favourite and reigning US Open champion Dustin Johnson started with a 71, the same as two-time major winner and world number three Jordan Spieth, while fellow American and world number five Bubba Watson was five under after six holes before a triple-bogey at the notorious par-three eighth saw him post a one-under 70.

2013 US Open champion Rose, 35, said it was the best he had played for some time, having struggled with a back injury this season.

""Typical me, playing the back nine in fewer shots than the front nine. But I'm certainly happy with the start.""
The nature of Troon's Old Course was better demonstrated by South African Haydn Porteous, who went out in 30, including two eagles, and came home in 40.
Day, who missed last year's play-off at St Andrews by one shot before winning the PGA Championship, his first major title, admitted he was struggling with his swing.
""Every time I hit an iron I kept missing everything left and it caught me off guard,"" said the 28-year-old Australian.
""It's frustrating but the next few days are going to be very difficult and if I can just play good, solid golf I can inch my way back in.""
Spieth, who also missed last year's play-off by one shot, was at a loss to explain his poor putting, which is usually his strongest suit.
""My [putting] stroke's been great heading into here,"" said the 22-year-old, who had 33 putts in his first round, nine more than Reed.
""I was much improved tee to green, struck the ball tremendously well, it just seemed like it didn't want to go in the hole once I got on the greens.""
Colin Montgomerie, an honorary member of Royal Troon, was first to tee off at 06:35 BST and double-bogeyed the opening hole.
However, the 53-year-old Scot, who came through qualifying, reeled off five birdies to turn in 33 before three bogeys on the back nine gave him a level-par 71.
""You'll see three- and four-under on the way out and then it's a matter of hanging on on the way back,"" said Montgomerie, a five-time major runner-up.
""And remember, this course hasn't shown its teeth at all. Today was three out of 10. On Friday we're talking seven or eight out of 10, and then it's going to be very different.""

"The price of Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel at one point, its lowest since 2003, while US crude fell as low as $28.36.
Many analysts have slashed their 2016 oil price forecasts, with Morgan Stanley analysts saying that ""oil in the $20s is possible"", if China devalues its currency further.
Economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland say that oil could fall to $16, while Standard Chartered predicts that prices could hit just $10 a barrel.
What are the factors have caused the price to sink below $30 a barrel - and what could spark a recovery?
In a nutshell, it's down to too much supply and too little demand.
China's economic slowdown has curbed appetite for commodities in general, while Saudi Arabia, which produces a third of the Opec cartel's output, is keener on preserving its market share than it is on cutting production to boost prices.
At the same time, the rise of the US as a shale oil producer means it now imports less oil, adding to the glut on world markets.
This makes life harder for other non-US, non-Opec producers, who are facing cutbacks, particularly in the North Sea.
Big oil companies such as BP, Shell, Total and Exxon Mobil have weathered the storm by cutting back on billions of pounds of investment, and thousands of jobs have been cut.
However, Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief economist at Charles Stanley, warns that further price falls could really start hurting the big firms.
The first clue that they are starting to suffer, he suggests, will be cutting dividend payments to investors - something they have avoided so far.
Meanwhile, Alan Gelder, of oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, says many North Sea oil operators are ""beginning to really feel the pain"" at current prices.
He says firms can just about survive as many North Sea operators have already cut costs. But Mr Gelder warns that ""there is no money left for future investment"".
Paul Stevens, professor emeritus at the University of Dundee, and a Middle East specialist, says the price of oil could theoretically fall to as little as $20 to $25 per barrel.
Why? It may be an unusual view but he thinks most US shale oil producers can tolerate current oil prices.
They may make a small loss - he estimates the cost of production at about $40 a barrel for shale producers - but until the price falls to around $25 a barrel they will keep producing, Prof Stevens says.
Mr Gelder, however, does not think many US shale operators can continue production with prices below $50.
""There are some sweet spots in the US where some operators are able to keep production going at lower levels, but it's not economic at under $30,"" he says.
There is also another much bigger problem than the future of fracking in the US.
""An awful lot of oil producers can't survive at these levels,"" Mr Gelder says. ""Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria are facing serious financial problems and political unrest with people out of work and prices rising.""
There is so much oversupply globally that countries are running out of storage. The US, which is thought to have among the largest storage facilities in the world, has nowhere left to keep it, says Prof Stevens. And it's not the only country.
""Storage is pretty much full and people are already talking about buying tankers as floating storage,"" he says. ""But if supply continues to outstrip demand, then the only thing that you can do with the oil is sell it, which inevitably pushes the price down.""
Mr Gelder takes a different view, suggesting it is not entirely clear whether US storage is completely full. ""We know about US and European storage levels, but India and China are strategically storing oil for supply disruptions.""
Mr Batstone-Carr adds:  ""Without a marked reduction in output nothing will change, and we have to wait until June for the next Opec meeting before we might see a reduction in quotas. And all of this comes at a time when economic activity is on the back foot, signalling there's not a lot of demand out there.""
Professor Stevens warns that the collapse in prices is the result of oil being ""freely traded for the first time since 1928"".
That, he says, is because Saudi Arabia has decided not to cut production to support prices - unlike during previous oil gluts.
It is just over four years since the US imposed sanctions on oil imports from Iran, helping to bolster prices and allowing Saudi Arabia to grab market share that it is now very reluctant to surrender.
A report from Wood Mackenzie says that the Saudis would not cut output to make room for Iran, which could begin exporting oil in the next few weeks, according to some sources.
""Unless other producers such as Russia, Iran and Iraq agree to reduce their oil production, Saudi Arabia has consistently stated since the November 2014 Opec meeting, it has no intention of cutting its supply to support oil prices,"" the report says.
""The current ramping up in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran only further confirms our view that Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its output to help Iran regain market share.""
Prof Stevens says tensions in the Middle East are ""as high as you could have them without having outright war. I don't think things have been as bad since 1918 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire.""
Such uncertainty normally sparks an oil price spike. But apart from a rise over the New Year, prices have continued to slide.
Mr Gelder says most oil traders shrugged off the possibility of Saudi Arabia and Iran squaring up to one another in a way that could seriously affect supplies.
And with demand for oil weakening, especially in China and emerging markets, there seems little reason to expect that prices are set to rise any time soon.
It means lower petrol prices, although what you pay at the pump may not fully reflect the oil price drop. Bear in mind that excise duty and VAT make up nearly 60% of the price of a litre, and that isn't coming down any time soon.
Obviously if people are spending less at the forecourt, they have more money to allocate elsewhere, and that is a potential boost to the economy.
However, if petrol-driven cars cost less to run, that means there's less incentive to invest in alternatives, such as electric vehicles, so in the long run, low petrol prices could be bad for the environment.

"Sixty seasonal workers have had their contracts terminated early and eight permanent staff have been made redundant at Surf Snowdonia in Dolgarrog, Conwy Valley.
The lagoon, which generates a man-made wave using new technology, suffered its third fault last week since it opened at the end of July.
Bosses have apologised to customers.
The lagoon was filled with more than six million gallons (33,000 cubic metres) of filtered rainwater for its opening but a fault led to it being emptied in August.
It was also shut for five days earlier in September due to a tear in the lagoon liner.
The latest fault is due to a ""serious failure"" of the main drive mechanism of the wave generating machinery which could take three months to repair.

"Cipriani, 28, will return to his first professional club after four seasons at fellow Premiership side Sale.
He has made 65 appearances for the Sharks - who currently lie seventh in the league - scoring 502 points.
Cipriani, who spent the 2011-12 season at Australian side Melbourne Rebels, has won 14 caps for England but missed out on the squad for the Six Nations.

"The Caps ended a seven-game winless run with a 3-2 home victory over Dundee Stars on Saturday before going down 6-0 on Tayside in Sunday's rematch.
And it left Johnston bittersweet after a weekend that promised so much on the back of their success in Murrayfield.
""Saturday's win felt really good,"" Johnston said. ""We've had some downs and battled adversity in the last few weeks so it was great to break that losing run.
""We were really looking for those points on Sunday and we didn't get them.  It was a good opportunity to make it a four-point weekend as they're close to us in the standings.
""We looked at it that way, but every game we go in, we have to be expecting a win.  We can't expect to beat certain teams and we have to starting getting victories if we want to start climbing.""
The mixed weekend left the Caps still three points adrift of second bottom Dundee after the two games, but they do have two games in hand over Marc LeFebvre's side.
That losing run, which consisted of them conceding an eye-watering 47 goals, came to an end as they beat the Stars 3-2 at Murrayfield on Saturday.
Ian Schultz and Matt Tipoff scored to bookend the first period as Edinburgh started the game in the best possible way, with Mason Wilgosh adding a third early in the second period.
Stars hit back through Matt White and Kevin Bruijsten, but couldn't find an equaliser to extend their poor run of form to 13 losses in their last 14 games.
The game went back to Tayside on Sunday as Dundee hosted, but the Stars snapped their own run of seven straight defeats with a 6-0 shutout win over Michal Dobron's side.
Dundee went four up during the second period when Mikael Lidhammar, Brett Switzer and two from Matt White put them in a comfortable position.
Two more from Justin Faryna in the third supplemented what turned out to be a good night for the Stars in the end.
Fife Flyers picked up two excellent points on the road at Manchester Storm on Saturday to begin their double header, winning 4-2 in a game that was goalless for the first 35 minutes.
Ryan Dingle eventually broke the deadlock before Taylor Dickin levelled as both teams went in after two periods, locked at 1-1.
Dingle restored the lead then Sebastien Thinel extended it before Matt Bissonnette pulled one back for the home team.  Flyers debutant Bryan Cameron added a fourth to take the win.
In Sunday's return game in Kirkcaldy, they made it two wins from two and four points with a 3-1 win on home ice.
Paul Phillips put the visitors in front late on in the first period, but the Flyers turned things around as Brendan Brooks and Dingle each scored, with Justin Fox adding a late empty net goal.
Braehead Clan started their weekend at in-form Nottingham Panthers and although they missed five players, they still took a point in a 4-3 overtime loss.
Lee Baldwin opened the scoring for the Clan, but Panthers turned the game around through Brian McGrattan and Matt Carter before Mike Hammond levelled for the Glasgow men.
Jeff Brown and Alex Leavitt traded goals for either team, taking the game into the extra period where Robert Farmer sealed victory with the overtime goal.
Clan returned to Glasgow to host league leaders Cardiff Devils and despite more heroics from the depleted team, finished with a penalty shots loss after a 2-2 draw.
Daniel Åhsberg's opener was cancelled out by Joey Hadded, before Bari McKenzie put Braehead in front in the second period, which was equalised through Andrew Hotham.
The Devils held out on penalty shots with their goalie Ben Bowns saving Åhsberg's crucial effort to secure the points for the Welsh side.

"PC Peter Hodgkinson discharged the weapon while Andrew Pimlott, 32, was holding a lit match at his parents' home in Plymouth in April 2013.
Mr Pimlott caught fire and died from his injuries five days later.
The officer said he only fired because he feared Mr Pimlott was about to send himself up in flames.
The inquest heard two police officers went to the home of Mr Pimlott's parents after his father called 999.
His father Kelvin said his son had a can of petrol and was threatening to set fire to the building.
The inquest previously heard the dead man had been served with a restraining order preventing him contacting his parents or going near their home.
After PC Peter Hodgkinson and PC David Beer arrived at the scene, they saw Mr Pimlott, who was in the back garden, douse himself in petrol from a can and strike a match.

"Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight.
It says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people.
UK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA.
Beat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence.
Teens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say.
Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure.
It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death.
Beat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities.
The charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states ""this is not a weight loss product"".
The Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets.
Dulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them.
The Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6.
Both and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).
""We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way,"" Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog.
""And that does include a significant number of young people as well,"" she added.
Lottie Hall is 17 years old. She started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was 13 and now has long term damage from laxative abuse.
""At first it would start with just a few, 4 or 5. Over time my body just got used to it and in the end I could be taking 20 to 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect.
""It was a long time, probably about 3 years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it.
""They'll be times where I'm out and all of a sudden it gets really uncomfortable and I have no control over it.
""I was a school once and I was in the corridor and was crouching down and holding my stomach in agony and my friend found me and she asked me what was wrong and I had to tell her and it was a really embarrassing situation.
""She actually had to tell my teacher and my teacher had to tell my mum.""
In 2009 Beat warned Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda that children were buying the medicine in large quantities. But the charity says nothing was done.
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) says that 1.6 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder and according to research from Beat, 80% of those surveyed by the charity admitted that they had misused laxatives in order to lose weight.
Dr Babu Vadamalayan, a paediatrician and gastroenterologist at Kings and St Thomas Hospital, told BBC Watchdog that the eating disorder unit at Maudsley Hospital say they see 140 under 18s with eating disorders every year and 10-15% of them are abusing laxatives.
As part of an investigation, BBC Watchdog sent four 14-year-old actors into 25 branches of Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Boots stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives.
The actors were not stopped or questioned by staff in any of the stores, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets in each store.
MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recognise the concern.
The body says it has consulted independent experts and believes that restricting the sale of laxatives or reducing pack sizes would not be appropriate.
However, it adds that it is working with manufacturers to get stronger warnings printed on products and will monitor their safety and take further action if necessary.
Boots and the four supermarkets said that they fully comply with current government and MHRA regulations on selling laxatives.
Sainsbury's and Boots added that they are retraining their staff to better identify signs of laxative misuse.

"Andreas Von Knorre and Elton Hinz pleaded guilty to entering a train depot and spraying graffiti on a train.
Singapore has strict laws on vandalism, and has caned and jailed foreigners in the past for the offence.
These include a Swiss national in 2010 and US teenager Michael Fay whose 1994 caning sparked global controversy.
Von Knorre, 22, and Hinz, 21, had flown into Singapore from Australia in November last year and vandalised a train during their stay.

"However, 43% of the people asked said they did believe in the resurrection - although many did not think it happened as described in the Bible.
The figures found while 57% classified themselves as Christian, fewer than 10% read the Bible and prayed regularly, or go to church at least once a month.
The Church of England's General Synod will discuss the survey in November.
The survey of more than 4,000 people was commissioned by the Church, Hope - which represents churches of all denominations - and the Evangelical Alliance - which represents evangelical Christians in the UK.
Many scholars agree that Jesus was a real man, who lived in Galilee more than 2,000 years ago, although many details surrounding his life are still debated.
But, the Church of England survey found that four in 10 people did not believe Jesus was a real person, with a quarter of 18 to 34 year olds believing he was a mythical or fictional character.
The poll was part of a wider research project looking at both practising Christians and the wider population.
After Christians, the second biggest group identified in the poll - 12% - were atheists, while 9% were agnostics, Muslims represented 3%, with Hindus and Jews both making up 2%.

"Pae Jun-ho, known in the US as Kenneth Bae, smuggled anti-government materials and plotted the state's downfall, a Supreme Court spokesman told state news agency KCNA.
He denied Mr Bae was being used as a ""political bargaining chip"" with the US.
Mr Bae was detained last year after entering North Korea as a tourist.
North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytism.
They were released after intervention from high-profile American figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both of whom went to Pyongyang.
The court spokesman told KCNA that Mr Bae was ""dispatched to China as a missionary"".
There he was involved in setting up ""plot-breeding bases"" from which he ""infiltrated at least 250 students"" into the North Korean port city of Rason with the aim of ""bringing the government down"".

""He committed such hostile acts as egging on overseas [North Korean] citizens and foreigners to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign,"" he said.
He added Mr Bae's full confession was the reason why he did not receive a possible death sentence.

"At the other end of the spectrum, there are plenty of people making goods a little better, and more expensively.
And most of these goods come with a big, luxury-brand label attached.
Di Gilpin's knitwear doesn't.
The prices are high, although not eye-poppingly so - in the region of £400 ($600, €550) for a sweater.
From her 15th Century bothy [one room stone cottage], near St Andrews in eastern Scotland, she has also created £4,000 knitted couture pieces for the catwalk.
It's anything other than a sleek, commercial machine: ""The bothy sometimes smells quite woody or peaty. Its like walking into a woolly, sheepy environment - a nostalgic smell, comforting and inclusive and homey.""
She says her creations also have a strong identity: ""When you see a piece walking down the street people recognise what it is.
""Hand-knits become you in a sense. As you wear them they take on you as a personality - you might get recognised in the distance for the garment you're wearing.""
Finding quality items with individual personality can be tricky as luxury-branded goods become more ubiquitous.
Uche Pezard, founder of luxury goods management consultancy Luxe Corp, illustrates this: ""I was in Dubai last week. I could have been in New York or Shanghai - the malls all look the same.
""Homogenisation of the luxury model is good in a way because it keeps consistency. But it becomes tiring - and boring.""
There's little homogeneity about US firm CustomMade.com, a website that claims to connect 12,000 makers with 100,000 buyers.
Customers effectively put their orders out to tender, so typically, these are one-offs.
You tell the site what you want, outline a budget, post an image if it helps, and designers and manufacturers will then offer their suggestions.
Its range of goods is almost limitless. It even made a Quidditch set for one couple.
CustomMade's president and chief executive, Seth Rosen, says: ""There are a lot of companies that connect people to existing products - things that are already made.
""We are unique in that we seek to connect people who want to get something that is not yet made, made.""
If there's one item that defines consistent luxury - but also individuality - perhaps it is the diamond.
In its pure form, this simple piece of rock doesn't come with a luxury brand label attached. Its appearance - and value - is enhanced by cutting and polishing.
At the SB Jewellery workshop in the UK's jewellery trade centre of Hatton Garden, London, Eddie Taylor is setting a diamond.
The stunningly beautiful stone is worth £18,000.
Part of the point of a diamond is its intrinsic value, he says. But even on a rock, sticking a well-known name on it can dramatically increase its perceived worth.
""If it's a Cartier, or a Tiffany, it will leap in price,"" he says. ""You can easily pay 150% more for a diamond with one of those labelled boxes.""
And even without the might of a big brand name, the value of a diamond is not set in stone, so to speak.
Eddie Taylor says that as mining giant De Beers tightly controls the supply of the precious stones, this underpins prices.
""De Beers has six skip loads of diamonds sitting about. Six skip loads. Imagine what that would do to prices if it were suddenly let on to the market. It would kill it.""
De Beers' released its diamonds in strictly controlled sales that take place just 10 times a year to specially invited customers. But it says that's not an artificial restriction. It says it only has enough ready to sell to supply two of these sales.
Whatever the case, restricting supply is certainly one of the best-used tricks in the book, says Uche Pezard: ""A Birkin or Kelly bag by Hermes costs about €10,000 (£7,200, $10,600). But they are simply not regularly stocked and you cannot go on a waiting list. You have to turn up at the shop and hope they have one on that day and you're in time to buy it.""
That means, she says, their resale price far outstrips the original retail.
""In the UAE [United Arab Emirates] it is considered a sign of the most serious intent if the man presents one on a first date. To do that, he has to pay €50,000.
""You know why? He doesn't have time to buy one himself, so he has to go to someone who already has one.""
Limiting supply is not a trick open to most smaller craft manufacturers. It is something Di Gilpin's small bothy does well enough in itself.
But getting her name out there is also hampered by its scale - and location. There a limit to the number of people who are going to pop in to browse in rural Fife.
So what do manufacturers do when they don't have the resources of a De Beers, an Hermes, or the other super-luxury brands?
But being the best can sometimes mean you get hunted out regardless.
CustomMade's Seth Rosen says word gets around: ""Our approach has been to take care of our makers, keep the customers happy, and the growth takes care of itself.
""Our product is good enough if you just execute really well every day. That's what makes the difference.""
When asked about her marketing budget, Di Gilpin laughs. It's so small it barely exists, she says. She will send you a USB stick loaded with films about the work, if you ask.
And that word-of-mouth can bring some impressive connections.
""Sometimes people come to us via quite odd routes,"" says Ms Gilpin. ""Nike came to us looking for an expert in gansey knitting [a type of stitch favoured for fishermen's jumpers].
""It was interested in exploring the concept of knitting to create their running shoes. We discussed why knot [stitch] was better for making those than weaving. The nature of the knot stitch allows the shoe to move with the foot - like a second skin.
""Now, a lot of Nike shoes are knitted rather than woven - and that was through them coming to us.""

The home side, leading by 136 on first innings, wobbled to 153-7 before Moeen's 59-ball knock took them 224-8 when rain forced an early close.
Under-fire opener Keaton Jennings managed only 18.
South Africa were earlier bowled out for 226 and will begin day four 360 runs behind.
The Proteas already need to break the record for the highest successful run-chase on this ground, with the pitch showing further signs of turn and uneven bounce.
England, 2-1 up, are chasing their first home series win against South Africa since 1998.

Bar captain Joe Root, who made a typically unflustered 49, none of the England top order were able to take advantage of home side's superior position in the game.
Collectively, South Africa's attack was excellent, none more so than pace bowler Duanne Olivier, who picked up three wickets in the Manchester gloom.
When Jonny Bairstow became the seventh wicket to fall, England were 289 ahead and in danger of letting South Africa back in.
Moeen, though, counter-attacked, dishing out some particularly brutal treatment to the previously economical Keshav Maharaj.
Targeting the leg side, left-hander Moeen hit the left-arm spinner for three sixes, sharing an eighth-wicket stand of 58 with Toby Roland-Jones, who contributed 11.
When the rain arrived at 17:15 BST, Moeen had taken 38 runs from the previous 22 balls he faced.
Media playback is not supported on this device
South Africa began the day on 220-9 and lost their last wicket when Olivier top-edged to Bairstow.
Trailing by such a large margin, they needed everything to go their way with the ball and, though the bowlers played their part, they were not always backed up in the field.
Jennings was dropped by Dean Elgar at third slip and Dawid Malan put down by a diving Temba Bavuma, with Kagiso Rabada the unfortunate bowler on both occasions.
A potential Ben Stokes edge off Morne Morkel did not result in an appeal, with the same batsman put down by Heino Kuhn at short mid-wicket off Olivier.
Bairstow and Roland-Jones also survived tough chances to Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis respectively.
None were particularly costly in terms of runs, but the same cannot be said about an edge from Moeen off Maharaj to Elgar at slip, which just about carried. Moeen was on only 15 at the time.
This was perhaps a last chance for Jennings, who averages 15.87 in eight innings in this series.
The Durham left-hander, the 11th different partner for Alastair Cook since 2012, had not scored when he was given a life by Elgar and battled for more than an hour before lunch.
Soon after the break he slashed at Rabada to be held at first slip by Amla.
If his place is the one that is most under-threat, then the other new batsmen in the England side still have work to do in order to establish themselves in Test cricket.
Tom Westley, who made a half-century on debut in the third Test, made only nine before edging a drive off Morkel, already a familiar dismissal.
Malan, who has managed just 35 runs in four innings, tamely inside-edged to short leg off Maharaj for six.
Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan: ""Maybe for Jennings it is best that he steps out of the pressure cooker, goes back to Durham and work on things.
""I think he has got better, he played a few nice defensive shots and a nice shot to cover, but he's not doing it consistently.
""Early in his innings he doesn't get his weight back on the ball.
""Who replaces him? Hameed was poor for Lancashire today, Stoneman would be next in line I think.""
Former England spinner Graeme Swann: ""Calls for Ian Bell to return? I don't think he will.

"Mr Justice Colton backed legal action by construction company FP McCann Ltd.
It brought the action after failing to land the deal to design and build the A8 dual carriageway between Belfast and Larne.
That was despite it submitting the lowest bid.
With the department also held to be in breach of a duty to the firm, compensation will be assessed at a later date.
FP McCann issued proceedings over the tender for the work it submitted in 2009 as part of a joint venture with Balfour Beatty in a public procurement process run by the DRD's Road Service.
The consortium, referred to as BBMC, did not secure the contract on the grounds that it had submitted an abnormally low tender, the court heard.
Lawyers for FP McCann claimed it had been unlawfully denied the work and should be entitled to damages.
The judge said there had been a clear breach of duty by the defendant in respect of its consideration of the BBMC bid.

"Kate McCann set off from Edinburgh on Saturday morning with about 20 other cyclists.
The five-day challenge is in aid of the Missing People charity.
It will pass through Newcastle, York, Nottingham and Northampton before crossing the finish line in London on Wednesday.
Mrs McCann is an ambassador for Missing People and last year launched Child Rescue Alert, which has seen more than 250,000 people sign up to receive alerts when a child is feared to have been abducted.
Her daughter Madeleine was three when she went missing from the family's holiday apartment in Portugal's Algarve on 3 May 2007.
The case has become one of the most famous missing persons cases of all time.
Mrs McCann said: ""The night that our little girl was taken from her bed, we mistakenly presumed that an alert would have gone out immediately to the public to get as many eyes and ears involved in the search as possible.
""But no such system existed to get a message out into the public domain quickly and recruit help.
""Although a simple idea, Child Rescue Alert is a potentially life-saving system, the success of which is reliant on us, as members of the public, to sign up to receive free alerts when a child goes missing.

"General Jonathan Vance, Canada's top soldier, has opened an investigation into the weekend incident and has called it ""deplorable"".
Video from the day shows a tense exchange between the servicemen and people attending the ceremony.
One claims they are members of an alt-right group called ""Proud Boys"".
That group describes itself on Facebook as ""a fraternal organisation of Western Chauvinists who will no longer apologise for creating the modern world"".
Among the values they cite are minimal government, anti-political correctness, closed borders, anti-racial guilt, anti-racism, glorifying the entrepreneur and venerating the housewife.
In video from Saturday's confrontation, the servicemen are seen carrying Canada's former ""Red Ensign"" flag, which includes the Union flag and went out of official use in 1965 after being replaced by the maple leaf design.
One woman is heard asking: ""What caused you to feel the need to bring a British flag?""
One man responds: ""Because it's a British colony.""
""You're recognising your heritage and so are we,"" another says.
After about 10 minutes, the group leaves the park.
Gen Vance, Canada's Chief of the Defence Staff, said in a statement that he ""detests any action by a Canadian Armed Forces member that is intended to show disrespect towards the very people and cultures we value in Canada"".
He adds: that any military member ""who is not prepared to be the defender we need them to be will face severe consequences, including release from the forces"".
Gen Vance said the servicemen involved have been removed from active duty and that their future in the military is in doubt.
A sixth armed forces member was also involved but is not under review, according to a National defence spokesperson.

"The economic research institute questioned 320 businesses following the vote on leaving the EU.
The survey found more than 60% of Scottish firms believe Brexit would have a ""negative impact"" on them.
However, the institute said there was little evidence of companies cancelling investment or recruitment outright.
The Fraser of Allander Institute, an independent research body based at the University of Strathclyde, carried out the survey between 5 July and 12 July, in the aftermath of the EU referendum.
Just over 60% of Scottish firms surveyed said they believed Brexit will have a negative impact on their business, while only 19% said it would have a positive impact. One third said the impact would be ""very negative"".
About 40% believe that leaving the EU could lead to a decrease in their investment and expansion plans, and 34% said that they could cut back on recruitment.
More than 70% of firms surveyed as part of the research had done no preparation for the UK exiting the EU.
Two-thirds of businesses said resolution of the uncertainty in the economy was a key issue in the negotiation of the UK's exit from the European Union, while 49% of firms cited access to the single market as a key issue.
However, the survey found little evidence of companies actually cancelling investment or recruitment plans.
A quarter of firms said they had made a decision to change their investment and recruitment plans, though the vast majority - 95% - said that decisions had been postponed rather than cancelled entirely.
Prof Graeme Roy, director of the institute, said: ""This is the first hard survey evidence post-referendum of what businesses in Scotland are thinking and how they are responding to the unexpected EU referendum result.
""A clear majority believe that the impact - certainly in the short to medium term - will be negative. The survey offers some evidence that investment and recruitment plans may be being put on hold.
""Resolving the current political and economic uncertainty must now be the key priority.

"The Transocean Winner, which has diesel on board, was under tow west of Lewis when it was hit by severe storms.
It became detached from the tug boat overnight, before running aground at the beach of Dalmore in the Carloway area.
Stornoway Coastguard said there were no personnel on board the rig and there was no risk to life.
However, coastguard personnel have blocked access to the beach for health and safety reasons.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch has begun an investigation into the incident.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it was monitoring for any pollution from the rig. The agency said Transocean Winner has 280 metric tonnes of diesel on board.
Scotland's Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said key agencies were doing what was necessary to ""ensure the rig is secured and to minimise any immediate safety or environmental risks"".
A spokesman said: ""Following the grounding of the semi-submersible drilling rig Transocean Winner on the Isle of Lewis, the Secretary of State's Representative (SOSREP) for Maritime Salvage and Intervention Hugh Shaw is now in discussions with the owners Transocean and the salvors.
""The Maritime and Coastguard Agency's counter pollution branch and the SOSREP have both been monitoring the situation since yesterday evening and the local authority, police and Marine Scotland have all been kept informed.""
Salvage company Smit has been mobilised to deal with the incident, the MCA added.
The Transocean Winner was being towed from Norway to Malta.
BBC Alba reporter Angus Macdonald said the structure was ""towering over the beach"".
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The rig has more or less come ashore at the beach of Dalmore.
""Dalmore is a well-known beauty spot. It is a sandy beach where a lot of surfers turn up because the waves are so good.""
Foster Evans, who visited the stretch of beach involved last week, sent BBC News Scotland online an image showing how the wide sweep of sand usually looks.
Western Isles SNP MSP Alasdair Allan and MP Angus MacNeil said the incident underlined the need for Scotland to have two emergency tugs.
An emergency towing vessel has been sent to the scene from the Northern Isles.
Scotland used to have two of the boats available to the coastguard to cover the north and west coasts, before the UK government reduced the service to a single ship in 2012.
Mr Allan said: ""This morning the tow line between a tug and the Transocean Winner oil rig snapped in heavy weather, resulting in the rig going aground at Dalmore on the west side of Lewis.
""I am grateful to hear that there have been no injuries reported after this incident but it does leave us with a significant environmental threat to deal with.

"The analysis of applications also shows big differences within the UK, with Northern Ireland youngsters the most likely to aspire to university.
Within England, teenagers in London are the most likely to seek places.
There are ""eye-catching regional variations in demand"", says Ucas chief Mary Curnock Cook.
The big picture shows an across-the-board, long-term rise in young people seeking places on undergraduate courses, which seems to be recovering from a dip following the increase in tuition fees.
But the figures from Ucas, based on 20 million applications between 2004 and 2013, show sharp differences behind the overall upward trend.
About half of young people now apply for university places - in England this rose from 36% to 44% between 2006 and 2010.
But whether a young person applies to university is heavily influenced by a number of factors, including social background, gender, ethnicity and where they live.
There has been a big increase in applications from ethnic minority youngsters in England, particularly black teenagers, rising from 20% to 34% between 2006 and 2013. Chinese teenagers are the most likely to apply, followed by other Asian youngsters, with white teenagers the least likely to apply, with 29% seeking places.
""Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils,"" says Ms Curnock Cook, the Ucas chief executive.
Nicola Dandridge, head of Universities UK, said the figures raised questions about ""why young white men from disadvantaged backgrounds are increasingly unlikely to apply to university"".
""It is critical that universities continue their outreach work to ensure that anyone who has the ability and potential to benefit from a university education should have the opportunity to do so,"" she said.
These figures show the proportion of young people in these ethnic groups who are applying - rather than the absolute numbers. Most applicants will still be white students, because it's a much larger group.
For instance, Ucas says the Chinese figure is based on about 2,000 youngsters, compared with about 500,000 white youngsters.
More youngsters from the poorest income groups are applying, but there are still significant gaps in terms of social background.
Teenagers from the richest areas are more than four times as likely to apply to the most selective universities than youngsters from the poorest areas. Youngsters who were on free school meals are only half as likely to apply to university compared with the rest of their cohort.
There are big geographical divides. In England, 42% of 18-year-olds in London apply to university, compared with 31% in the north east.
London state schools have been commended for having the best results in England.
Across the UK, Northern Ireland has a significantly higher level of applications than elsewhere, with 48% of 18-year-olds applying, compared with 31% in Wales.
Gender remains one of the biggest factors in application rates, with females remaining substantially more likely to apply. In 2012 in England, 49% of women applied compared with 38% of men.
All of these factors overlap, so that a woman from Northern Ireland is much more likely to seek a university place than a man from Wales and a white youngster from the north east of England is less likely to apply than a black teenager in London.
Les Ebdon, director of the Office of Fair Access, welcomed the fact that the gap in applications between richest and poorest was narrowing.
But Universities UK warned that the figures did not show applications from mature and part-time students, which have been hit by the increase in tuition fees.
""Numbers of mature and part-time students have decreased considerably since 2010 and any further drop may have significant implications for potential students and the country as a whole,"" said Universities UK chief, Nicola Dandridge.
A Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokeswoman said: ""These figures confirm that the desire to study at university remains strong, with application rates for 18-year-olds at near record levels.
""Some challenges remain but no one should be put off going to university for financial reasons. Our reforms mean students do not have to pay fees upfront, there is more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone faces lower loan repayments once they are in well-paid jobs.""","Black and Asian teenagers are more likely to apply to university than white youngsters in England, according to the Ucas admissions service.",23405792

Mr Putin said there would be ""no discussions"" about Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that was seized by Kremlin-backed forces in 2014, leading to sanctions from the EU and US.
The territory, which has an ethnic Russian majority, later voted to join Russia in a referendum that Ukraine and Western countries deem illegal.
How Russia's relationship with Europe has evolved
Mr Tsipras told reporters: ""We have repeatedly said that the vicious circle of militarisation, of Cold War rhetoric and of sanctions is not productive. The solution is dialogue.""
Mr Putin said: ""As far as Crimea is concerned, we consider this question is closed forever. Russia will not conduct any discussions with anyone on this subject.""
Mr Putin's visit to Greece is an attempt to reinforce a relationship with one of Russia's friends in Europe at a time when diplomatic tensions continue between Russia and the EU and US, the BBC's Thomas Fessy in Athens says.
Mr Putin also said that Russia would be forced to respond to US moves in Europe, warning that Washington's missile shield bases in Romania and Poland were a direct threat to his country's security.

"However the single point was still enough to send opponents Kinlochshiel top of the table.
The four pointer in Drumnadrochit to escape the relegation play off place gave Glenurquhart their first Premiership victory for two months, 2-0 at home to Lochaber.
Mid table, a late surge gave Lovat a 3-1 success at Kingussie but without a change in league placing for either side.
And in the National Division, Kilmallie's 5-1 victory at Ballachulish means that they trail leaders Glasgow Mid Argyll only on goals scored.
There had been much pre-match build up as Kinlochshiel prepared for their first trip across the Skye Bridge for a long time on serious shinty business and it was the visiting side who opened the scoring through Duncan DA MacRae after just 12 minutes. And there it looked as if it would stay until the penultimate minute when Murchison secured a share of the points.
However Skye, with four draws in five games, still seek their first victory. Although Shiel are now a point clear of previous leaders Kyles, whose Celtic Society Cup tie in Oban was postponed, they have also played three more games.
Glenurquhart, their defence of the MacTavish Cup already at an end and sitting second bottom in the league, were desperate to kick start their season on the visit of Lochaber. After a goalless first half, David Smart opened the scoring early in the second and Conor Golabek put the points in the bag late on. This leaves Lochaber in the play off place on goal difference and with two extra games played.
At The Dell, Kevin Bartlett put Lovat ahead midway through the first half and Thomas Borthwick got Kingussie's equaliser shortly after half time. Greg Matheson gave Lovat the lead again but it was only after Euan Ferguson's third in the final minute that they could breathe easily.

"It is the first private clinic to offer early medical abortions to women in Northern Ireland under strict legal controls.
A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012.
Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was ""time to move on"".
She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board.
Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre.
Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down.
""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic.
""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said.
""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south.
""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances.
""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose.""
Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.
""The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers.
""We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.""",Dawn Purvis is to step down as programme director of Northern Ireland's Marie Stopes clinic.,32254316
"He faced questions from MPs as the UK government published a White Paper, setting out its approach on Brexit.
It lays out 12 ""principles"" including migration control, free trade and ""taking control of our own laws"".
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said her party would do everything it could to prevent the damage of a ""hard Brexit"".
As the White Paper was unveiled, Montgomeryshire Conservative MP Glyn Davies asked Mr Davis for assurances that Welsh interests would be considered.
Putting the question, Mr Davies said: ""In the interests' of UK unity, Wales' interests must be taken into account, including discussion of this white paper.
""Can you guarantee the involvement of Wales and continue to feature in all of our discussions, accepting of course that there can be no veto?""
The minister told him: ""You are absolutely right and that's been the approach we've taken.
""We've had a number of meetings of the joint ministerial committee, two of them chaired by the prime minister, three of them chaired by me.
""We've been to Wales to see the Welsh Government to talk about some of these issues.
""The minister of state [David Jones] is appearing before the Welsh committee shortly on February 14.
""So we are taking the interests of Wales extremely seriously, and we will operate this negotiation so that no part of the United Kingdom loses. That's the aim.""
Mr Davis was also challenged by Bridgend Labour MP Madeleine Moon to guarantee tariff-free access to European markets for car workers in Bridgend and steel workers in south Wales.
He told her that EU countries exported more to the UK than the UK exported to them, ""so they clearly have a strong interest, as strong an interest as we do in tariff-free goods access"".
Mr Davis added: ""There's every reason to expect that we will succeed in what we intend to do which is to protect the jobs of her constituents.""
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood dismissed the White Paper as a ""whitewash of the demands of Wales"" as seen by her party and the Welsh Government.
They had called for ""full and unfettered"" access to the single market after Brexit in their own White Paper published in January.
""Today, the UK Government has confirmed it will forge ahead with a hard Brexit, dragging Wales out of the European Single Market, threatening 200,000 Welsh jobs and making tariff barriers likely,"" she said.

"Cardiff's Techniquest was already told it could lose the government cash by 2019 but it has now been given more time to make new plans.
The centre, which around Â£850,000 annually from ministers, said it needs to find new ""revenue streams"".
Funding worth about Â£450,000 for its sister but separate charity in Wrexham is also ending over the same period.
The 30-year-old Cardiff organisation has relied on Welsh Government funding for 40% of its income.
Since 1986, it has had more than five million visitors, including at least 1.5m school pupils on organised trips.
It moved from Cardiff city centre to Cardiff Bay in 1995.
A separate group runs a site at Wrexham's Glyndwr University campus, which opened in 2003.
Lesley Kirkpatrick, chief executive officer at Techniquest, said: ""Last year, we were made aware that the core funding to Techniquest would reduce and eventually come to an end.
""Consequently we were expecting a funding cut next year and in subsequent years.
""Our core grant from the government will continue until 2021, allowing us time to explore other options, and we are extremely grateful for this.
""There are a number of plans being developed which will help us identify alternative revenue streams and secure the long-term sustainability of Techniquest.""
Iwan Thomas, chairman of the board of the Wrexham Techniquest Glyndwr site, said: ""We've already been proactive at looking at alternative funding streams.
""We are looking at extending our remit so it ties in with regional and cross-border economic opportunities and the needs of the STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics] agenda.""
He said he did not think the site would close as a result of the funding cut, adding: ""We are mature enough in Wrexham to look outside of the box"".
The decision by Cabinet Secretary for Education Kirsty Williams comes after former education minister Huw Lewis said in January that Techniquest was ""overly dependent on public funds"".
""It's not a sustainable position,"" he had told AMs at the time.
It is understood that the grant will be reduced each year.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are working closely with Techniquest and Techniquest GlyndÅµr to support their move to a more sustainable financial position, without reliance on Welsh Government core grant funding.
""Both organisations have agreed to a five-year programme of support (from 2016-17) to help better manage the reduction in core funding and we will continue to work closely with them to explore any other funding opportunities in future.""","Funding for two Techniquest science museums in Wales will end from April 2021, the Welsh Government has said.",37234805

"Publicly, his business was business; but, for almost quarter of a century, he was at the centre of an extraordinary chain of events that ultimately led to the historic IRA ceasefire of 1994 and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.
He did that by agreeing to becoming a top-secret contact between sworn enemies - the IRA and the British government.
Mr Duddy was a key link - from the early 1970s to the early 1990s - between the Provisional IRA Army Council and the Secret Intelligence Service, acting on the orders of various British governments.
He even hosted talks in his own living-room involving a top British spy and Martin McGuinness - talks that would ultimately pave the way for peace in Northern Ireland in the 1990s.
Born on 10 June 1936, Mr Duddy spent his early adult life running a family fish and chip shop in Londonderry. His wife Margo worked behind the counter. She described it as a ""meeting place, where everyone came and sat and chatted"".
Ironically, the beef burgers were delivered by a certain young van driver called Martin McGuinness. The same young militant republican would rise to the leadership of the IRA and one day - perhaps indirectly through Mr Duddy's peace efforts - become his country's deputy first minister. Mr McGuinness died in March.
Mr Duddy's apprenticeship as intermediary came in the days before Bloody Sunday in 1972. He was asked by a friend, Frank Lagan - a fellow Catholic who happened to be Derry's police commander - to try to persuade the Provisional and Official IRA to remove their weapons from the Bogside.
After some soul-searching, Mr Duddy made contact with both organisations and they agreed to the request, with the exception of a few weapons left behind by the Officials for so-called defensive purposes.
Then came Bloody Sunday, when British paratroopers shot dead 13 civil rights marchers during an anti-internment demonstration in Derry on 30 January, 1972. A 14th died later.
Many consider the events of that day a turning point in Northern Ireland, and Mr Duddy warned Frank Lagan that it would have catastrophic consequences.
""We are going to have a war on our hands,"" he said.
In the ensuing violence in 1972, 479 people were killed, the highest annual death toll in what was to become known as the Troubles.
The scale of the violence only served to heighten Mr Duddy's determination to work towards peace - a goal it would take unsung heroes like him, and others, more than 20 years to achieve.
In 1973, he was introduced to a British government official he knew as Michael Oatley, who was, in fact, a spy from the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), code-named ""The Mountain-Climber"".
Mr Duddy was to become the messenger between the IRA and the British government, the secret back channel who would pass messages between the two sides and, eventually, arrange meetings between them.
The process resulted in direct talks between the British and the IRA leadership in 1974-5, some of which took place in Mr Duddy's own home on Derry's Glen Road.
The republican side included IRA chief-of-staff Seamus Twomey, senior Belfast IRA commander Billy McKee, and the then Sinn Féin President Ruairí Ó Brádaigh.
During this time, the IRA declared a ceasefire, but it broke down in the face of loyalist violence and the talks ended.
The process resumed during the IRA hunger strikes of 1980 and 1981, in which Bobby Sands and nine other prisoners died.
Mr Duddy, once again, was the link between the IRA and the British government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
Codenamed ""Soon"", Mr Duddy was a conduit for messages passed back and forth between the two sides.
During this time, ""Soon"" used his contacts to arrange for leading republican Danny Morrison to visit the prisoners in Long Kesh, or The Maze.
But the negotiations were fraught with difficulty, as well as a lack of trust on both sides.
It would take 10 deaths before the fast was called off in October 1981.
Days later, most of the prisoners' demands were met.
Sinn Féin was to emerge as a growing political force in Northern Ireland, as republicans now began to use the ballot box and the Armalite hand in glove.
In the early 1990s, Mr Duddy hosted talks at his home between Mr Oatley and the intelligence services, and the republican leadership including the late Mr McGuinness.
Talking to the enemy had created the opportunity for peace and in 1994, after more than 3,000 deaths, the IRA declared a ceasefire.
Mr Duddy's work as the secret peacemaker"" was almost done - and the Good Friday peace agreement was signed four years later.
According to Martin McGuinness, Mr Duddy's successful role in the peace process was so renowned it even reached Colombia.
In 2014, Mr McGuinness said that when he met President Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian leader told him that when his government opened a back channel with the rebel group Farc, the negotiator was codenamed ""Brendan"".
The peace process was not the only area in which Mr Duddy used his mediating skills.
Between 1997 and 2002, he co-chaired talks, along with other members of Londonderry's business community, aimed at resolving tension around the city's Apprentice Boys parade. The event is now largely trouble-free.
He was also a former independent member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
Meanwhile, his business career thrived - the family firm, Duddy Group, has interests in property, bars, restaurants and hotels, including Derry's City Hotel and the Ramada Hotel in Portrush.","Brendan Duddy - a Londonderry businessman described as Northern Ireland's ""secret peacemaker"" - has died aged 80.",39887873
"Heads and teachers have been complaining about deepening problems with funding shortages - with warnings they might have to cut school hours.
The ministerial response shows 5% of council schools have budget deficits.
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said funding gaps had become a ""national scandal"".
""Over 1,000 schools are in the red. This should be worrying to every parent,"" said Mr Farron.
His party had asked ministers how many schools and academy trusts, which run chains of schools, were in debt.
There have been growing warnings from schools about problems with funding.
The heads of every state school in West Sussex recently sent a letter to Downing Street, warning that they would have to consider cutting school hours or making teachers redundant if they did not receive emergency funding.
They warned that schools faced a ""dire financial position"".
In a debate this week on school funding in West Sussex, MPs backed their concerns.
Sir Nicholas Soames, Conservative MP for Mid-Sussex, said funding arrangements were ""unsatisfactory and unfair"" and budget shortages would have a ""damaging effect"" on schools.
Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing, said there was ""nothing left in the tank"" for many schools and that head teachers were telling him that school finances were at ""breaking point"".
Head teachers say that budgets have not kept up with rising costs.
There are also particular regional shortfalls, with the government postponing plans to introduce a national funding formula aimed at addressing local anomalies in funding levels.
Education Minister Nick Gibb's reply to the question on schools in debt showed that in 2014-15 there were 113 academy trusts with a revenue deficit, representing 4% of trusts.
There were 944 local authority schools in deficit, representing 5.3% of such schools.
The National Association of Head Teachers said problems with school funding were ""very serious"".
A spokesman said a survey showed that two-thirds of schools were ""dipping into reserves to stave off deficits"" - and there were fears that rising costs would make this worse.
""I worry that in order for schools to bring their budgets in line to repay their debt, they will have to look at cutting staff, which makes up for 80% of the school expenditure,"" said Mr Farron.
""There will be less extracurricular activities, IT equipment or even books as cash is funnelled into clearing the debt.""
Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, called on the government to provide ""immediate additional funding"".
""School budgets are being cut to the bone, and many more could find themselves in debt as the funding crisis worsens.
""We estimate that 92% of schools in England could face real terms budget cuts over the next four years.""
But Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""All academy trusts must balance their budget from each academic financial year to the next.
""We continue to monitor the tiny number of trusts which reported a deficit at the end of the academic year 2014-15.""","Almost 1,000 local authority schools and more than 100 academy trusts in England are now in debt, ministers have revealed in an answer to a parliamentary question.",37860725
"The monitoring of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland was conducted by the IMC up until 2011.

Talks will begin next week in Belfast in a bid to resolve the current crisis,  sparked by the murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Sr.
Police believe that killing was in retaliation for the murder of former IRA commander Gerard Jock Davison in the Markets area of Belfast in May.
The Ulster Unionists withdrew from the executive after police said Provisional IRA members had a role in the killing.
""The current crisis is of a different order,"" Lord Alderdice told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme.

"NHS Highland required an additional £2.5m to help it break even in 2013-14.
In a new report, the public audit committee has heavily criticised the health board's financial management.
NHS Highland said it had acted to address the concerns, and that it wanted to ensure both its finances and governance met ""the highest standards.""
The public audit committee gathered evidence from the health board's bosses, who answered MSPs' questions at two public meetings.
In the report, the committee said NHS Highland and its largest hospital - Raigmore in Inverness - continually overspent.
MSPs questioned how well informed board members were of the financial situation.
Committee convener Paul Martin said: ""The fact that, for example, Raigmore Hospital continued to overspend year-on-year, despite £5m extra funding in 2012-13, suggests to us a culture of complacency about budgetary oversight at the hospital and at the NHS Highland board.
""The slow progress in addressing the causes of the overspending at Raigmore was exacerbated by the practice of creating compensatory underspends elsewhere in NHS Highland in order to break even.
""What was clear to the committee was that without brokerage there could have been serious repercussions for patients.""
NHS Highland has previously said the deal agreed to secure the additional £2.5m was the first time it had taken such action in 15 years.
It said it could have been forced to cancel operations and cut services if the Scottish government had not given it the funds.

Hibs have two games in hand on Falkirk, who lie in the promotion play-off spot, with Rangers a further 11 points clear at the top.  But Falkirk could extend their advantage to nine points by beating Livingston on Saturday.
""It's close and that's fair play to Falkirk, and something we're disappointed by,"" McGinn noted. ""We're determined to get that second place and make sure we've got the best chance of going up.
""I'm not playing as well as I was just before Christmas. As a team, we're all not playing as we can and that's evident in the results that are coming for us. We're working hard to try to nail down what the problem is and I'm sure we'll get back to winning ways sometime soon.""
McGinn feels he has developed as a player since his move from St Mirren to Easter Road last summer, and credits Stubbs and the Hibs coaching staff for his improvement.
As captain of the Scotland Under-21s, he was one of several young players who impressed Gordon Strachan when he spent time with the squad last November.
The 21-year-old aims to use his time training with the squad ahead of the Denmark game at Hampden to show he can make the step up to full international level.
""It's a big step up and I'm really looking forward to showing I'm capable of making that step up,"" he added. ""That's something myself and some of the other new boys will be looking to do.
""The last trip with the 21s that Gordon was there, we knew from the stuff that Ricky [Sbragia] was telling us that he was really keen on how people conducted themselves about the place and in training.
""We knew that if we trained well, we'd have a chance and he'd have a look at us. It's something that I'll be looking to do this time again and hopefully perform as well as I did the last time.
""My first few initial games for Scotland [Under-21s] were difficult. I didn't adapt well, but the more I played the more I got used to the international style. Being the captain of the 21s added a bit of maturity and helped me for the step up.""","John McGinn admits Hibernian's players are ""baffled"" by the team's recent slump in form in the Championship.",35883715
"The British supermarket giant, the world's third largest retailer, has been looking to dispose of its loss-making US food chain for some time.
Around 4,000 of Fresh & Easy's 5,000 employees are to transfer to the new business as part of the deal.
Tesco said in a statement that this is an ""orderly and efficient exit from the US market"".
Under the terms of the deal, Tesco will loan the new business around Â£80m.

"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane.
But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights.
Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007.
He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure.
The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans.
Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex?
No.
Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets.
""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference.
""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'""
When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion.
In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example.
Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights.
Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.
""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns.
""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it.
""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.
""I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff. Who'd have thought I'd be sitting here world champion again?""
Hearn said suitors could ""make all the offers they want, we'll listen"".
""If they want to come with a sack-load of money for Ricky to defend his title against Broner in Vegas, I'm sure there are a few Scots who would like a trip there as well.""
At that point Burns quipped: ""I'd be one of them.""
The lovely thing is, you suspect Burns was speaking in the guise of a fan rather than that of a three-weight world champion who could enjoy a profitable title defence.","In a sport beset by tiresome braggadocio, Ricky Burns seems like an impostor.",36409093
"Responsible Travel, based in Brighton, specialises in wildlife holidays and says keeping animals in zoos is inhumane.
About half a dozen tours that involve zoos are being dropped from the firm's roster of 3,500 possible trips.
The firm's boss, Justin Francis, took the decision after watching a BBC TV programme ""Should we close our zoos?""
""Having watched the programme my firm conclusion was that these zoos are no longer relevant,"" he told the BBC.
""They are relics of the past, and the arguments to justify keeping animals in captivity no longer stand up.""
Mr Francis argued that most animals kept in zoos were not endangered and that there had been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity.
Most of the zoos involved in the firm's decision are in southeast Asia and none are in the UK.
The travel company markets about 3,500 tours from 350 operators in the UK and abroad.
It stopped offering tours involving elephant rides about 18 months ago.
It will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centres, animal rehabilitation centres and breeding centres for endangered species.
Mr Francis explained that it had taken two staff six months to research the zoos and other destinations being offered in his clients' holidays.
Identifying the zoos had taken just a couple of weeks, but scrutinising the other animal facilities on offer to travellers had taken much longer.
The decision to weed out trips to traditional zoos was welcomed by a wildlife charity, the Born Free Foundation.
""[Our] investigations have, over the years, demonstrated that few animal species can adapt to a lifetime in captivity, with many individual animals developing abnormal behaviour, not seen in their wild counterparts, in order to cope with captivity's restrictive and often barren environments,"" said the president of Born Free, Will Travers.
""A global shift in public consciousness, a movement, may see - if not an end - a massive reduction in the exploitation of wild animals in their millions in thousands of zoos worldwide,"" he added.
Mr Francis said none of the tour operators whose holidays had been dropped had objected to his decision.
""They told us they hadn't thought things through but now they have been presented with the evidence they agree"", he said.","A leading marketer of ""responsible tourism"" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.",39479367
"The culture committee questioned journalists and bosses at the now-closed News of the World, as well as police and lawyers for hacking victims.
Its report has concluded
 that Mr Murdoch exhibited ""wilful blindness"" to what was going on in News Corporation.
But the committee was split six to four with Tory members refusing to endorse the report and branding it ""partisan"".
Conservative Louise Mensch called it ""a real great shame"" that the report's credibility had potentially been ""damaged"" as a result, with the report carried by Labour and Lib Dem members backing it.
News Corp said in a statement it was ""carefully reviewing"" the report and would ""respond shortly"", adding: ""The company fully acknowledges significant wrongdoing at News of the World and apologises to everyone whose privacy was invaded.""
The committee itself does not have the power to impose sanctions, but it raised the possibility of a vote in the House of Commons about whether witnesses had been in contempt of Parliament - and if so, whether those witnesses should be forced to apologise in Parliament.
By Robert PestonBusiness editor
The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the report was much more damning than had been anticipated and directly questioned the integrity and honesty of Rupert Murdoch.
BBC business editor Robert Peston said it would push Ofcom, the media regulator, closer to the conclusion that BSkyB - 39% owned by News Corp - is not fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence.
Reacting to the report, an Ofcom spokesman said it was ""continuing to assess the evidence - including the new and emerging evidence"" that may assist it in ruling on that issue.
The committee of MPs began its inquiry in July 2011 in the wake of fresh revelations about the extent of hacking at the tabloid newspaper, with reported victims including the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and the families of victims of the 7/7 London bombings.
It heard evidence from Mr Murdoch and his son James, and has now concluded that the notion that a hands-on proprietor like Rupert Murdoch had ""no inkling"" that wrongdoing was widespread at the News of the World was ""simply not credible"".
It noted that the newspaper mogul had ""excellent powers of recall and grasp of detail when it suited him"", and added: ""On the basis of the facts and evidence before the committee, we conclude that, if at all relevant times Rupert Murdoch did not take steps to become fully informed about phone hacking, he turned a blind eye and exhibited wilful blindness to what was going on in his companies and publications.""
Tory MPs objected specifically to the line branding Mr Murdoch ""not fit"", with one, Philip Davies, telling a press conference the committee had seen ""absolutely no evidence"" to endorse such a ""completely ludicrous"" conclusion.
But Labour MP Tom Watson said ""more than any individual alive"", Mr Murdoch was to blame for phone hacking, and it was right to ""raise the bar"" of the report and make that clear.
The committee also criticised three former News International executives - one-time executive chairman Les Hinton, former News of the World editor Colin Myler and former legal manager Tom Crone - accusing them of giving misleading evidence.
Mr Myler, who is now editor of the New York Daily News, said he had ""always sought to be accurate and consistent"" when speaking to the committee and stood by his evidence.
Mr Hinton said the allegations against him were ""unfounded, unfair and erroneous"".
Mr Crone said he accepted there were ""valid criticisms of my conduct in this matter"", but he was ""the subject of serious allegations which lack foundation"".
News Corp as a whole was guilty of ""huge failings of corporate governance"" and, throughout, its instinct had been ""to cover up rather than seek out wrongdoing and discipline the perpetrators"", the committee said.
And it concluded: ""Corporately, the News of the World and News International misled the committee about the true nature and extent of the internal investigations they professed to have carried out in relation to phone hacking; by making statements they would have known were not fully truthful; and by failing to disclose documents which would have helped expose the truth.""
James Murdoch told the committee last summer that he did not see an email which suggested that hacking was more widespread at the paper than previously acknowledged - a claim disputed by Mr Myler and Mr Crone in their evidence.
On that matter, the report concluded that James Murdoch was ""consistent"" in relation to the so-called ""For Neville"" email, but he had demonstrated ""wilful ignorance"" about what had been going on, which ""clearly raises questions of competence"" on his part.
James Murdoch has insisted he did not know about any wrongdoing at the News of the World, but took ""his share"" of responsibility for not uncovering it earlier.
He gave evidence alongside his father Rupert, who at one point during the hearing was attacked by a man who rushed forward from the public gallery and threw a paper plate of foam at him.
The committee also said former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks must ""accept responsibility"" for presiding over a culture at the News of the World that led to journalists impersonating members of Milly Dowler's family and hacking the teenager's phone.
And it criticised Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer and former Acting Deputy Commissioner at the Metropolitan Police John Yates for failing to ensure hacking claims were properly investigated.
After initially claiming malpractice was limited to one ""rogue"" reporter at the News of the World, News International has now settled dozens of civil cases admitting liability for hacking between 2001 and 2006.
More than 6,000 possible victims have been identified and the police have so far made a number of arrests in connection with an investigation reopened in January 2011 - although no charges have yet been brought.
Asked whether David Cameron regarded Rupert Murdoch as a fit person to run a media company, his official spokesman said: ""That is a matter for the regulatory authorities, not for the government.""
Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg both said Ofcom must now be allowed to come to its own conclusion.
The hacking revelations led to the closure of the News of the World and the government's decision to set up a judicial inquiry into press standards headed by Lord Leveson.
Appearing before the Leveson Inquiry last week, Rupert Murdoch said there had been a ""cover-up"" which ""shielded"" senior figures at the paper and its parent company - including himself and his son James - from knowledge of wrongdoing taking place.","Rupert Murdoch ""is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company"", MPs have said.",17898029
"Liberty, headed by Sanjeev Gupta, was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale.
A spokesman for Liberty told the BBC that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers.
""The formal process is to submit a letter of intent; it amounts to a bid. It will be done on Tuesday,"" he said.
In addition to the Port Talbot factory - the UK's largest steelworks - Tata's remaining assets include sites at Newport, where more than 1,300 people are employed, and Rotherham, which employs 1,200. Tata also has operations at Corby, Shotton and Teesside.
Macquarie, the Australian bank, was advising Liberty on a potential bid, and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover.
Liberty House started life in the university room of Indian-born founder Sanjeev Gupta.
While a student at Cambridge University in 1992, the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than £2bn.
With operations in 30 countries, and headquarters in London, Dubai, and Singapore, Mr Gupta's Liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of Britain's steel industry.
Liberty's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the UK, rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces.
Last month, it acquired Tata Steel's plants in Lanarkshire. In recent years, it has reached similar deals for steel plants in Newport and the Black Country.
A management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name Excalibur Steel UK Limited.
It has appointed investment banker Mark Rhydderch-Roberts as a non-executive director. He joins Stuart Wilkie, the head of Tata's United Kingdom strip steel business, and former Alcan senior executive and venture capitalist Roger Maggs, on the board.
The government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25% stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available.
Tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal, but has made it clear it cannot sustain its £1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers.
Tata's Scunthorpe operation, which employs more than 3,000 people, has been sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a nominal £1.","Liberty House plans to submit a formal bid on Tuesday to buy Tata Steel's UK assets, which include the Port Talbot works employing about 4,000 people.",36189022
"Dilapidated windows at HMP Pentonville are worsening a drug problem at the London jail, its Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) said in a report.
It found blocked toilets and leaking sewage, and said the escapes and the killing of an inmate demonstrated ""serious shortcomings"".
The Ministry of Justice said more resources were being put in place.
Members of the IMB visit the jail several days a week throughout the year and said ""aspects of the physical environment of Pentonville are inhumane"".
It said: ""Confining two men in a cell measuring 12ft by 8ft is not humane treatment.
""One has to eat his meal in the cell while the other may be sitting on a badly-screened toilet a few feet away.""
It added: ""The prison struggles to ensure the basics of decency largely due to the outsourced provider responsible for maintenance - Carillion.""
It concluded: ""The contract is working neither for Pentonville nor the taxpayer"".
A Carillion spokesman said: ""The age and condition of Pentonville prison presents maintenance challenges which our people work hard to overcome.
""Although the level of reactive maintenance jobs has increased we have continued to improve our performance against the agreed targets.""
The Category B prison is holding 380 more men than the Prison Service deems it suitable for, the IMB said.
The report raised concerns about the risk to safety from the prison's old windows, whose replacement was recommended by the National Offender Management Service following the fatal stabbing of Jamal Mahmoud, 21, in October 2016.
It said: ""Less than a month later two prisoners escaped through a cell window.""
Matthew Baker, 29, and James Whitlock, 32, went on the run after sawing through a metal bar, clambering over roofs and swinging round a CCTV pole on a sheet.
""Until all the windows are replaced contraband received by drone or from throw-overs will continue to put the safety of staff and prisoners at risk,"" the report added.
""If cells cannot contain prisoners, then the safety of the public is also at risk.""
A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""Pentonville has been through a very challenging period. While the Board notes progress has been made in improving staff safety with body worn cameras for all uniformed staff, and new CCTV to tackle the flow of contraband into prisons, it is also clear there remains much more to be done.
""We are boosting the frontline by recruiting more staff at HMP Pentonville and for prisons across the estate.

"Its ethical policy states that any artwork using Lego products should not ""contain any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements"".
However, the Danish company was widely attacked by commentators and accused of not wishing to annoy the Chinese government, which Ai regularly criticises.
Lego has now relented and on Wednesday announced that it had changed its policy.
It will no longer ask customers what they want to use the bricks for, but requests that they make clear that the company does not support or endorse their projects, if exhibited in public.
But should a business be picky about whom it sells to?
The problem is that selling as much as you can to anyone and everyone can have unintended consequences.
Some customers can turn into your competitors.
LVMH, which owns luxury brands from Christian Dior clothing to Dom Perignon champagne, has had its Chinese business undermined by bulk sales ferried into the country by so-called ""daigou"" agents.
Taxes and currency differences make luxury goods far more expensive in China. Some analysts estimated that by mid-2015, Chinese prices were 60% higher than those in Europe.
The daigou agents, many of them students making extra cash to finance their overseas studies, buy up luxury products in bulk in Europe and Hong Kong and sell them on at home. It is sometimes known as parallel trading.
So LVMH started to watch its customers more closely.
Speaking on a conference call earlier last year, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, said: ""We've placed strict retail restrictions for the amount of products that people can buy.
""But, when you see someone in a store, you don't know whether they are buying handbags for themselves or to sell them on to the market in China. We are trying to make sure we are not competing with our own products in the China market, but our actions are not entirely bullet-proof.""
Other companies have found it easier to try to equalise prices. The fashion house Chanel raised its European prices by 20% and cut them in China, directly competing with the daigou agents and successfully eroding their profit margins.
This kind of grey market happens everywhere.
A supermarket might halve the price of a box of chocolates in a sale and sell them all to a single customer, only to see them turn up in the corner store down the road, undercutting their recommended retail price, a fortnight later.
That's not illegal, but there are ways to stop it - by restricting sales.
The British Retail Consortium's external affairs adviser, Bryan Johnston, says: ""In the end, it is up to the individual store. It is in the gift of the retailer to decide on how much they want to sell to any one customer.""
Many supermarkets imposed restrictions two years ago when the scandal over contaminated baby milk in China prompted overseas Chinese to buy up formula and import it into China.
However, these were more to do with trying to stop a run on the product at home than trying to stop any kind of parallel trading abroad.
But for some retailers more is, well, more.
Marks and Spencer spokeswoman Clare Wilkes says: ""A few years ago, a woman came into one of our stores and bought up the every piece of cashmere we had. We had no objection to that - at all.""
But the luxury goods industry on the whole is very choosey about whom it sells to.
The most famous example is Burberry, which by 2006, when Angela Ahrendts became chief executive, was growing just 2% a year in a booming luxury market.
It was selling everything from kilts to dog cover-ups and leashes - to everyone.
Ms Ahrendts wrote later in the Harvard Business Review: ""In luxury, ubiquity will kill you - it means you're not really luxury anymore. And we were becoming ubiquitous.""
Ms Ahrendts completely restructured the company, drastically reducing its product range, centralising production and design, making it more expensive and then, restricting the customer base.
She added: ""We began to shift our marketing efforts from targeting everyone, everywhere, to focusing on the luxury customers of the future - millennials. We believed that these customers were being ignored by our competitors.""
The restrictions it imposed were financial. The kilt and dog-leash buyers were simply priced out of the market. Many of the core Burberry products, such as the signature trench coat, now cost more than $1,000 (Â£700).
Brand consultant Rebecca Battman says: ""There are unintended consequences of your brand becoming popular - the more widely seen it becomes, the more it will diminish the power of the brand among the people you really want to appeal to.""
Ms Ahrendts' strategy worked. Within five years, Burberry's revenues and operating income had doubled and 2014-15 revenues rose 11%. Less had become more.","When Lego originally decided not to sell the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei bricks with which to make a political statement, it really thought it was doing the right thing.",35303799
"The 85 children had to eat peanut protein every day - initially in small doses, but ramped up during the study.
The findings, published in the Lancet, suggest 84% of allergic children could eat the equivalent of five peanuts a day after six months.
Experts have warned that the therapy is not yet ready for widespread use.
Peanuts are the most common cause of fatal allergic reactions to food.
There is no treatment so the only option for patients is to avoid them completely, leading to a lifetime of checking every food label before a meal.
The trial, at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, tried to train the children's immune systems to tolerate peanut protein.
Every day they were given a peanut protein powder - starting off on a dose equivalent to one 70th of a peanut.
The theory was that patients started at the extremely low dose, well below the threshold for an allergic response.
Once a fortnight the dose was increased while the children were in hospital, in case there was any reaction, and then they continued taking the higher dose at home.
The majority of patients learned to tolerate the peanut.
Claire Rooney describes the daily anxieties of having a daughter with multiple food allergies.
'Niamh's allergies have changed our lives'
Lena Barden, 11, from Histon in Cambridgeshire, said: ""It meant a trip to the hospital every two weeks.
""A year later I could eat five whole peanuts with no reaction at all.
""The trial has been an experience and adventure that has changed my life and I've had so much fun, but I still hate peanuts!""
One of the researchers, Dr Andrew Clark, told the BBC: ""It really transformed their lives dramatically; this really comes across during the trial.
""It's a potential treatment and the next step is to make it available to patients, but there will be significant costs in providing the treatment - in the specialist centres and staff and producing the peanut to a sufficiently high standard.""
Fellow researcher Dr Pamela Ewan added: ""This large study is the first of its kind in the world to have had such a positive outcome, and is an important advance in peanut allergy research.""
But she said further studies would be needed and that people should not try this on their own as this ""should only be done by medical professionals in specialist settings"".
The research has been broadly welcomed by other researchers in the field, but some concerns about how any therapy could be introduced have been raised.
Prof Gideon Lack, who is running a peanut allergy trial at the Evelina Children's Hospital in London, told the BBC: ""This is a really important research step in trying to improve our management of peanut allergy, but is not yet ready for use in clinical practice.
""We need a proper risk assessment needs to be done to ensure we will not make life more dangerous for these children.
He warned that 60% of people with a peanut allergy were also allergic to other nuts so a carefree lifestyle would rarely be an option.
Prof Barry Kay, from the department of allergy and clinical immunology at Imperial College London, said: ""The real issues that still remain include how long the results will last, and whether the positive effects might lead affected individuals to have a false sense of security.
""Another issue to address is whether there will be long term side-effects of repeated peanut exposure even where full allergic reaction does not occur, such as inflammation of the oesophagus.
""So, this study shows encouraging results that add to the current literature, but more studies are needed to pin down these issues before the current advice to peanut allergy sufferers, which is to avoid eating peanuts, is changed.""
Maureen Jenkins, director of clinical services at Allergy UK, said: ""The fantastic results of this study exceed expectation.
""Peanut allergy is a particularly frightening food allergy, causing constant anxiety of a reaction from peanut traces.
""This is a major step forward in the global quest to manage it.""
Prof Simon Murch, an allergy expert at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""This is clearly a promising paper but it certainly isn't a cure.
""Nevertheless this study does point towards a promising new direction of therapy and once further testing has been carried out, and techniques refined, it may prove to be a therapy with widespread use in hospitals in future.""
But he added: "" This is not something that should be undertaken at home, or indeed outside specialist centres.""",Doctors say a potential treatment for peanut allergy has transformed the lives of children taking part in a large clinical trial.,25917272

The 20-year-old striker scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 win over St Johnstone on his return from injury as a second-half substitute at McDiarmid Park.
Chelsea were reportedly considering a £40m offer for the Frenchman.
""I am happy to learn here and that's why I signed here,"" Dembele told BBC Scotland.
""I am learning at one of the biggest clubs and I'm enjoying it.""
Dembele, who had missed Celtic's previous two games, has now scored 23 times for the Scottish Premiership leaders since his £500,000 summer move from Fulham.
Rumours that Dembele was in talks with Chelsea were fuelled when he was spotted on a flight to London on transfer deadline day.
Celtic insisted that he was travelling to see a knee specialist - close to Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium - regarding a recent injury.
And the Glasgow club also stressed that no official offer materialised from the Premier League leaders.
Dembele had responded to social media speculation on the day by tweeting a picture of himself in a Celtic strip and in the same pose as Leonardo Di Caprio in the movie Wolf Of Wall Street when his character proclaims he is not leaving his company after all.
Following the win over St Johnstone, the striker reiterated that he had been in London ""for my scan"".
Dembele also insisted he had not been affected by Chelsea's alleged interest and said: ""I don't really listen to the media. I'm a Celtic player and I'm happy to be here.
""I try to improve here and show people the player I am and that I'm happy to be here and I showed that today on the pitch.""
Asked how long he was likely to remain at Celtic Park, Dembele replied: ""I can't tell you that I will be here for 10 years or 20 years. I don't know.""
Celtic had to come from 2-1 behind to beat St Johnstone, with Dembele equalising with a controversial penalty after referee Craig Thomson ruled that a Kieran Tierney cross had struck Keith Watson's arm.
The striker insisted that he had not been concerned about the possibility of his side losing their first domestic match of the season.
""I know the quality of the team, so I know that, if we keep playing the way we have all season, we will beat St Johnstone,"" added Dembele.
""So, even when we were behind, I was confident.

Defoe moved to Sunderland in January 2015 after a brief spell at MLS side Toronto and, after saving the club from relegation in the 2015-16 season with 15 goals, signed a contract extension until 2019.
There was a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave on a free transfer if Sunderland were relegated, which he was able to trigger when the Black Cats finished bottom last season.
Defoe made his England debut in 2004 and played at the 2010 World Cup, but did not feature for the national side between 2013 and 2017.
His excellent form last season earned him a recall to Gareth Southgate's side, and he scored his 20th international goal against Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier in March.
Defoe is Bournemouth's second signing of the summer, following the arrival of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic from Chelsea.
""We want to bring players here who can have a big impact on our continued rise and we believe Jermain fits that as a natural, proven goalscorer,"" added Howe.
The Cherries finished ninth in the Premier League last term - their second season in the top flight.

"MOTD2 pundit Alan Shearer looks at the reasons why Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side won the Premier League by such a convincing margin and explains why it will be hard to stop them achieving more success.
Every part of their team did their bit but the biggest reason for their success is one man, Jose Mourinho. His influence was huge.

The Blues manager is a serial winner who lives for titles and trophies - and he knows exactly how to get what he wants.
I don't accept the 'boring boring Chelsea' jibes his side have faced recently. I think that is utter rubbish.
It is not Chelsea's problem if teams cannot beat them, and it is pretty embarrassing if they then call them boring.
The only tag the Blues deserve is 'worthy champions' because that is what they are. Everyone else has a lot of catching up to do.
One of the biggest reasons Chelsea won the title is that, unlike his rivals, Mourinho identified what he needed last summer, and went out and got it.
I am sure he was hurt by what happened to Chelsea last season, his first back at Stamford Bridge since his last spell ended in 2007.
Despite not having a really top-class centre-forward they went very close to winning the title.
Near-misses don't mean anything to Mourinho, though.
He addressed the main issue holding his side back by signing Diego Costa, who has scored the goals that were missing.
Chelsea were also lacking a bit of guile in midfield, and Cesc Fabregas has provided the extra creativity there.
His midfield partnership with Nemanja Matic, who Mourinho signed in January 2014 to sit and police the back four, is just one part of a team system that works perfectly.
Chelsea have some top players, but their squad also has a great hunger and desire. That is down to their manager.
By the end of the season, Chelsea will have broken the record for the most days spent on top of the table, and also the most consecutive days.
They were joint-top with Manchester City at the start of January but, since they kicked their first ball of the campaign, the only time they have not been at the summit was after the second round of games.
Their players had the character to deal with it. From August onwards, they have been the team to beat and the best team full-stop.
That underlines their consistency over the last nine months, and shows the almost total control they have had on the title race.
Even when they were hit for five by Tottenham on New Year's Day, no panic set in.
That was one of their very few bad days, which are inevitable over a long season, but they never suffered a slump for a sustained period of time.
They have never had to play catch-up in the title race and are not used to doing it in individual games either. Again, they are usually in control.
They have scored the first goal in 27 out of their 35 league matches, which is obviously important for any team, but especially for Chelsea.
When you have a defence like they do, they are very rarely pegged back when they get in front.
I keep hearing that players need to be rested and rotated but Chelsea don't do it, and their approach seems to have helped rather than hindered them.
Instead, Mourinho uses a core group of players who start whenever they are available.
That includes Eden Hazard, who is hardly ever taken off either, something that is rare for an attacking player.
At the back, John Terry has been magnificent and he has played every single minute of every league game.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The rest of the back four - Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and Cesar Azpilicueta - play whenever they are fit.
Compare them to, say, Manchester City who chop and change their defence a lot and you can see the benefit of a settled unit who work relentlessly together.
Chelsea have had 17 clean sheets out of 35 league games, and they have only conceded more than two goals twice.
They were pretty good at the back in the first half of the season when they were scoring goals freely. Until 17 January, only Southampton had conceded fewer goals.
But in the past few weeks when they have been more pragmatic in the way they have been getting results, they have been even better at the back.
From August to January, Chelsea played some sparkling football and you only have to look at their attacking statistics to see that they were anything but dull.
So they earned the right to play the way they have been in the last few weeks, when they have been protecting their lead at the top of the table.
I put that change in approach down to form and fitness of some of their players, with Costa's absence being the obvious example.
The important thing was that Chelsea kept winning, though, and they have done that.
None of their rivals have managed it over the duration of the season and the way I would sum up this campaign is that Chelsea have been brilliant and the rest of the league has not been good enough - by quite a margin.
City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have all been disappointing, especially when you look at the money they have spent, because they are further away from Chelsea now than they have been for a while.
Chelsea have done the job they set out to do at the start of the season, which is to win the title.
They have the best defensive record in the Premier League and only City have scored more goals. They also have the best player, Hazard.
Put all of that together and I just cannot accept they are dull.
They have not got the credit they deserve but I don't think that bothers Mourinho one iota.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The only thing that matters to him is winning the Premier League, and he has done that with ease.
He has his third title in English football, and now he will want more.
He can get that with this Chelsea team, which certainly does not need much work done to it over the summer.
I am pretty sure a centre-forward will be high on Mourinho's shopping list because we have seen how much they have missed Costa when he has been out.
Also, Didier Drogba is 37 now and I am not sure how long he can keep going.
But the main thing for Chelsea is that Mourinho is not going anywhere - while he is around, there are more trophies to come.

"In a letter to all party leaders, the Equality and Human Rights Commission expresses concern about hate attacks that have taken place since the UK voted to leave the EU in June.
It calls for ""accurate information and respectful debate"" from politicians.
The Home Office said extra money had been allocated to tackle hate crime.
The commission's letter, which is co-signed by its chairman David Isaac and chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath, said politicians had spoken about ""the need to heal the country and bring people together"" following the UK's EU referendum.
But instead, it said: ""There is growing concern that the divisions on a range of big questions are widening and exacerbating tensions in our society.""
It pointed to the killing of Arkadiusz Jozwick, racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic attacks on the streets, and reports of hijabs being pulled off, all of which it described as ""stains on our society"".
The letter comes after Thomas Mair was jailed for life on Wednesday for the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox during the referendum campaign.
Prosecutors said the attack was ""nothing less than acts of terrorism"" and the judge said it was carried out to advance a political cause of violent white supremacism.
The commission, an independent statutory body which advises on equality and human rights law, said: ""We are concerned that attacks on supporters of both sides of the Brexit debate have polarised many parts of the country.
""There are those who used, and continue to use, public concern about immigration policy and the economy to legitimise hate.
""The vast majority of people who voted to leave the European Union did so because they believe it is best for Britain and not because they are intolerant of others.""
It describes the Brexit vote as a ""defining moment"" for the country, saying that while the focus has been on the economic and trading implications there should also be a ""discussion on what values we hold as a country"".
The letter also criticises the government's aborted plan to demand companies set out the proportion of foreigners they employ, which was announced by Home Secretary Amber Rudd at the Conservative Party conference in October.
It said ""politicians of all sides should be aware of the effect on national mood of their words and policies, even when they are not enacted"".
The letter also mentioned the discussion around child migrants, ""where dialogue escalated to irrational levels"".
And it said there had been an ""ambivalent reception"" to claims of anti-Semitism in politics, an issue that BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said had dogged the Labour Party in particular.
The commission said it welcomed the government's hate crime plans, but said more concerted action was needed.
It suggested there should be a review of the sentences for hate crimes in England and Wales.
Home Office figures released in October showed racist or religious abuse incidents recorded by police in England and Wales jumped 41% in the month after the UK voted to quit the EU.
The Home Office said there was ""absolutely no excuse"" for such offences and extra money had been allocated to tackle the issue.","Westminster party leaders should tone down campaigning that has ""polarised"" the country and ""legitimised hate"", the equalities watchdog has said.",38120596
"The book was compiled by the fleet's senior medical officer as a ninth birthday gift to his son in 1943.
Autographs include Flt Cdr Henry Melvin ""Dinghy"" Young, second in command of the raid, who was shot down and killed on his return.
The book was sold in Newark, Nottinghamshire.
The seller's father collected the signatures at the RAF base at Scampton, Lincolnshire, where Squadron 617 - better known as the Dambusters - was formed in March 1943.
Bombing raids on three major dams in Germany's industrial Ruhr Valley took place in May using Barnes Wallis' bouncing bomb. Of the 19 planes that went, eight were lost.

"Hugh McGoldrick spent six days in jail after admitting falsifying drug trials on patients with sleep disorders.
The former GP, from Crossgar, County Down, was then brought before a Medical Practitioners Tribunal (MTP) hearing.
Last month, it ruled his name would be erased from the medical register but he was given 28 days to appeal.
At the time, his solicitor said McGoldrick did not accept the MTP findings and had ""every intention of contesting them"".
But the MTP had not received any appeal when the 28-day deadline passed on Wednesday, 29 March.
On Thursday, a spokesman for the MTP said: ""We have not received any confirmation of an appeal either from the court or the doctor.
""So Dr McGoldrick's name will be removed from the register today.''

"The family of Joseph Murphy has hit out at authorities for the delay.
Forensic tests have confirmed that the bullet was fired from a military-issue weapon.
Mr Murphy, 41, a father of 12, was injured in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in August 1971 and died 13 days later in hospital.
Nine others were also killed during a series of shootings by paratroopers over three days.
The shootings occurred during Operation Demetrius, when paramilitary suspects were being detained and interned without trial.
The bullet was found in the body of Mr Murphy in October 2015.
Mr Murphy's family have said that they believe he was shot at a military barracks after being injured and that the bullet may still be lodged in his leg.
However, his daughter, Janet Donnelly, said that the delay in examining the bullet had hurt her family as they have been unable to rebury him.
""I received the report a couple of days ago,"" she said.
""They know rightly my daddy hasn't been reburied yet and won't be until all these tests are completed. And they're sitting on their hands doing nothing.""
Mrs Donnelly's solicitor Mark O'Connor said: ""This is significant because it confirms what we already suspected - that there was a bullet lodged in Mr Murphy's body which wasn't picked up by a post-mortem.
""This will help us to establish the type of weapon used and potentially the trajectory that it entered Mr Murphy's body.""
Mr Murphy was shot in the thigh and taken to the Henry Taggart army barracks, where he said he was shot through the open wound a second time.
Earlier this year, Coroner Jim Kitson told a preliminary hearing an exhumation order had been granted because of the ""exceptional circumstances"" of the case.",A bullet found in the exhumed body of a man killed in shootings in Ballymurphy in 1971 was not sent for forensic examination for three months.,35673690

"A journalist and stock market officials are among those arrested, Xinhua said. It gave no other details.
Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets.
The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing.
A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua.
Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts.
The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"".
Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.
The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.
The news agency said ""seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II"" were also among the offences.
A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of ""spreading fake information"" about the market slump, the report said.
The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he ""wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications"".
In 2013 Chinese authorities introduced a possible three-year sentence for spreading rumours - the sentence was supposed to apply to anyone who posted a rumour that was reposted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times.

"It was President Hassan Rouhani's first reaction to the results of Friday's run-off election, in which moderates and reformists won a working majority.
The 17 women elected make up 6% of the new cohort of 290 MPs.
Only 16 cleric MPs have been voted in, meaning the new parliament will include more women than religious leaders.
President Rouhani acknowledged the new record and said: ""People chose the best candidates in the 26 February and 29 April elections.""
The BBC's Kasra Naji says the results signal ""a major shift in public support away from hardline Islamic conservatives"".
Friday's run-off election was held in constituencies where no candidate had won the minimum proportion of the vote in a first round in February. Four women were elected in the run-off, joining other women who had been voted in already.
The outgoing parliament includes nine female representatives.
Friday's vote gives women in Iran the same share of seats as in countries including Thailand and Nigeria.
Why Iran's moderates must capitalise quickly
An 18th woman was elected but her votes have been annulled by the Guardian Council, a constitutional oversight body. No reasons were given for excluding Minu Khaleqi after the first round.
President Rouhani lent support to her in his speech on Sunday when he told an audience ""18 female legislators"" had been voted in.
The election of a record number of women is a sign of a major shift in public support away from hard-line Islamic conservatives who have taken only 26% of seats - a dismal performance.
This shift is also apparent in the fact that almost all hardline clerics lost their seats. The number of clerics in parliament in Iran has steadily declined over the years from 164 in the first parliament just after the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Islamic hardliners see the declining number of clerics elected as a threat to the Islamic revolution and have called on more clerics to come forward and enter politics - at a time when many ordinary people are turning away from the religious leaders.
The elections have now ended the 12 year dominance of the Islamic hardliners over parliament.

"Liam Craig swept home Steven MacLean's delivery in with 14 minutes gone.
ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break, leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second.
Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish.
Inverness, now propping up the league table, have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership.
Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal. Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box.
When skipper Warren was sent-off you feared the worst for Inverness. His first yellow was for persistent fouling. His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him. The resultant free-kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead.
Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle's cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre-back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence.
St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match. Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals.
It was better in the first half. Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal.
Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves.
There was a swagger about Wright's side after they opened the scoring, but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead.
They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge. It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away.
St Johnstone deserved another goal, though, and it came after Warren's dismissal, Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free-kick.
Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time, as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory.
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We started on the front foot, got the goal, then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit. Inverness got back into it without causing us many problems.
""Our achilles heel this season has been not defending crosses into the box and set plays, and I thought the two centre-halves and Murray Davidson in particular dealt with them well.
""Swanson's goal is a good, quality goal, and we probably could've scored more when they went down to 10. I'm pleased with the three points and probably equally pleased with the clean sheet.""
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""We got what we deserved. We've gone from one of our best performances of the season (against Dundee) to probably our worst. It's very disappointing. Talk about being inconsistent - that's sums us up this season.
""You're in there before games trying to motivate them and they're talking the talk, all the clichés, and they're going out there and not walking the walk. Go do your talking on the park - we didn't today.
""I can't be too harsh on the lads, their attitude is wonderful day in, day out, but you get paid to perform in the match and we've not performed over the last three or four games.
""But I know exactly what I need to bring in - our problem is we've got too many attack-minded players, we're right up there on the goal charts, but we're worse off on goals against, so we need more defensive-minded players and I'll go and get them (in January). The funds are there.""

"The 33-year-old goalkeeper was busy in a 3-3 draw, his first taste of the Champions League group stage.
Having been the number one choice for the past two seasons, Gordon was playing after Dorus de Vries picked up an injury at the weekend.
""I was happy with how I played - that's all I can do,"" he said.
""Everybody wants to be a part of nights like that. There is no bigger incentive to play well and keep your place.""
Former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon started the first nine matches of the season but lost his place to summer recruit De Vries in mid-August.
Gordon was a half-time replacement in Saturday's win over Kilmarnock, with the 35-year-old Dutchman suffering a chest injury.
De Vries was fit enough to be among the substitutes in a thriller with Manchester City in which Gordon made two good stops to deny Ilkay Gundogan, one late in the game from a deflected strike.
""This is the highest level of club football and to finally manage that at the age of 33 is a special moment for me,"" said Gordon.
""We'd have liked to get the three points but it was an incredible effort against a top quality side.""
Asked how the match ranked in his long career, he replied: ""It's right up there. The atmosphere was just incredible.
""The noise was unbelievable. There was a couple of times when I was absolutely screaming at Kolo [Toure] to leave the ball and he just couldn't hear me. I couldn't have shouted any louder.""
Gordon, capped 44 times for Scotland, insists his self-belief has not wavered since dropping to the bench and is hoping manager Brendan Rodgers will find it difficult to reinstate De Vries.
""I've always been confident in what I'm able to do,"" he added. ""It was other people saying my confidence was gone.
""If I've not been selected, that's the manager's decision and I fully respect that.
""The other side of that is that I want to play every game.
""I think I've done pretty well in stages this season and if I can get a run in the team then hopefully I can go from strength to strength.""",Craig Gordon hopes an impressive display against Manchester City can help him retain a regular starting position at Celtic.,37499133
"The retailer has been under fire over zero hours contracts and disclosure that staff at a warehouse were paid less than the minimum wage.
Independent shareholders had called for changes to the way the company was run.
Sources told the BBC that Mr Forsey was ""not coerced"", and that Mr Ashley is a permanent replacement, not temporary.
The billionaire businessman has given up his role as executive deputy chairman.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said sources told him that the shake-up was not part of a plan to take Sports Direct private.
There has been speculation that, following months of criticism of the company, Mr Ashley wanted to remove Sports Direct from the stock market.
Mr Ashley, who owns more than 50% of the company, said in a statement: ""I feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future.""
Mr Forsey has worked for the retailer for 32 years after starting as a part-time worker when he was 18.
Earlier this year he agreed to forgo a £3.7m share award in recognition of the problems at the company.
Mr Forsey said: ""I have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences.""
Sports Direct's board made two other changes, promoting Karen Byers to the role of global head of operations, and Sean Nevitt to the role of global head of commercial.
Amid criticism over Sports Direct's working practices and bad publicity, there had been calls by shareholders for the removal of chairman Keith Hellawell.
The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after an investigation uncovered that staff were kept on site at its giant Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire after their shifts for body searches.
These took so long that their pay effectively dipped below the minimum wage.
Mr Ashley, Sports Direct's billionaire founder, was called to answer questions from MPs, who compared working practices at the warehouse with ""that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern High Street retailer"".
In the wake of that, the sportswear chain's lawyers produced a critical report of its working conditions.
The company was criticised for its use of zero hours contracts. It says it will offer workers who want them guaranteed hours. It also said it would put a worker on the board.
That report also criticised Mr Forsey for failing to inform the Sports Direct board about some of the issues at Shirebrook.
But calls for an independent review continued and earlier this week, Sports Direct said it would authorise such a study of working practices and corporate governance, following concerns raised by shareholders.
Mr Ashley denied knowing much about the way Shirebrook operated, telling the BBC: ""You'd be surprised how little I knew of what was going on.""
Like so many in the company's hierarchy, Karen Byers, Sports Direct's new global head of operations met founder Mike Ashley informally and has known him a very long time.
She's been with the company for more than 20 years and it is said she got the job after trying to sell Mike Ashley a pair of jeans. Despite being head of retail at a publicly-listed retail giant with 30,000 employees for much at that time, she's very low profile indeed.
Earlier this year Mike Ashley himself singled her out in a rare interview he gave to the Times newspaper: ""Karen Byers runs Sports Direct. She runs the retail, all the money comes out the retail, [the warehouse workers and store managers] are her army. She is the person who sets the rules. Not me.""
One investment analyst firm said she was well regarded inside the company and out. The same firm though said she was not known for her ""flowery or evasive approach"". Just like her boss.
Paul Blomfield, a member of the Business Innovation and Skills committee which grilled Mike Ashley in June, is not convinced by the changes: ""What our committee wanted to happen was for the company to seriously address what was, not just problems around the edges, but systemic labour exploitation in the workplace. And whether Mr Ashley is the person to do that - given the evidence he gave to our committee - is yet to be seen.""
Mike Fox, from shareholder Royal London Asset Management, wasn't impressed with Friday's board changes either: ""The installation of Mike Ashley as chief executive, consolidating his influence at the top of the business, is unlikely to reassure anyone.""
He said the way the company was run had long been a problem and that Sports Direct still needed a new chairman before it could rebuild trust with investors.
Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder pressure group, Manifest, told BBC Radio 5 live the move added another corporate governance problem: ""Are we going to see [Mike Ashley] step down from his other job as deputy chairman?
""Had Mike Ashley listened to shareholders four or five years ago, we might not be in the situation we're in at the moment.""
She said the company's actions were not just damaging to shareholders but ""undermined the general public's perception of capitalism - full stop"".
Nevertheless, market reaction suggests most investors were pleased that Mike Ashley would have a more direct role in the company and the shares were up about 5% in morning trade.
Mr Ashley's brash style is unorthodox for the founder and executive of a leading UK company. The owner of Newcastle United football club was photographed with a wad of cash when he took shareholders and journalists on a tour of the Shirebrook site after the shareholders' meeting.
He also revealed that he travels to work by helicopter. The company employs Mike Ashley's daughter's boyfriend to run its property arm.
Financially, the company is not in a good place.
The company's shares have fallen by 50% this year, and earlier this month Sports Direct warned that that profits next year would be down on this year.","The founder and majority owner of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, has stepped in as chief executive after the surprise resignation of Dave Forsey.",37448915

"MAP HERE (MAKE SURE MAP LIVE): 36696356
Elena Hrabovenska goes to the staff area to retrieve the letter from her handbag. From the way she has spoken about it, I'm expecting a long, heartfelt message. But it's a simple note scrawled on scrap paper:
""My wife told me that hate mail and phone calls have been made to the Polish shops in Huntingdon. The people who do this are a minority. The Poles add to Britain: they have always been welcome.""
Days after the historic referendum to leave the EU, cards with the words ""No more Polish Vermin"" were left outside schools and homes in Huntingdon, where Elena runs a Polish deli.
""On that day five British people came into the shop and they said they are really sorry. They are ashamed of that person who's done it.""
Elena's main concern, she says, is that words will escalate to physical violence.
After struggling to find the right words, she says: ""Around the world you will always find someone who has the stone instead of the heart.""
Elena owns three Polish delis, one in Huntingdon and two nearby in Peterborough.
She came to England in 2003 from Ukraine, aged 19. She arrived alone on a working visa, with Â£100 in her pocket. She knew nobody.
At the time there was only one shop selling Central and Eastern European food in Peterborough, she recalls.
Despite having a good grasp of English, she struggled to find the ingredients she needed to make the traditional soups she missed. This gave her the idea to open a deli with food imported from Central and Eastern Europe, with staff that can speak Polish and Russian.
A few years after arriving in the country, her first deli was born.
To stock that first shop, her husband would continually make the 36-hour round trip to Poland by van.
There was a clear business opportunity as more and more Poles arrived in the UK, after they were given the right to work here in 2004.
Elena's business grew and a decade later, she employs 20 people and has two refrigerated trucks making the journey to Poland and back.
There is an obvious irony, of course, that she was a Ukrainian building a Polish deli empire. But in fact many of the Polish delis that have emerged in the UK are owned by non-Poles. Many are run by Turkish businessmen and women. It is a similar phenomenon to Bangladeshis owning Indian restaurants.
When asked how she feels about the referendum result, her first thought is for her business.
""We put against this business basically everything, the time we could spend as a family... to achieve this place we would work 48 hours without a wink [of sleep].""
Her fear is that her delis will be hit by a weaker pound and ultimately, if the UK leaves the single market, import tariffs on Polish food.
""I feel responsible for my staff. I don't want to face that time when I have to announce, 'I'm sorry girls I have to close, I have to cut staff or hours.' They have families as well, they have children.
""All of them were asking what is going to happen and I didn't want to answer.
""[But] I know we live in the 21st Century, someone is not going to knock on our doors and throw us away.""
Peterborough voted by 60.9% in favour of leaving the European Union.
Customers have not talked about it, ""like they are in shock"", says Elena.
But the result did not surprise her. She has noticed ill-will towards migrants in the city.
Peterborough is often cited as a place strongly affected by EU internal migration.
The last census revealed that its population rose by almost 18% between 2001 and 2011, reaching 183,631. People from Central or Eastern Europe made up 7.7% of the city's population by 2011. Many are drawn by the seasonal farm work available nearby.
""Some immigrants are not perfect and put a black mark on the immigrant's name,"" says Elena.
However, she says she wants people to remember that ""a lot of families are coming here to seek a better life and work hard"".
Her latest, newly-opened shop is a bright mini-supermarket, neatly tucked behind a Tesco, nestled next to a Chinese takeaway.
She reckons 25% of her customers here are English.
With so many rival Polish delis, she explains, she has had to open this larger shop to compete on choice.
Despite successful expansion, migration of another kind has posed the biggest threat to her business, she explains.
Gridlock at Calais caused by illegal migrants has disrupted her fragile supply chain. She has had to unload trucks through the night to make up for lost transit time.
On one of the walls in Elena's shop you will see Polish football scarves, magazines, adverts and books that are all in Polish.
""When customers come into the shop they think they are back in Poland,"" remarks Elena.
So does she think shops like hers represent a failure to integrate with the local community?
This kind of shop ""will vanish"", she predicts, after a pause, by way of answer.
""There is a new generation coming. Obviously they will still have in their hearts that their parents were Polish, but they will integrate into the English community as happened with other nationalities.
""There will be mixed families, with Polish mums and English dads, for example, two cultures mixed together.
""It's going to soften.""

"Around 400 residents in east Rhyl were forced to leave their properties when severe storms breached the sea defences in December 2013.

The third and final phase of Â£1.1m of improvements by Denbighshire Council is due to start on Tuesday.
Cllr David Smith, of Denbighshire Council, admitted the flooding was a ""major catastrophe"" and major work had been done to protect properties from a repeat of three years ago.
""It will be a lot safer knowing what we know now, but the one thing that I cannot say, that no one can say, is that it will not happen again,"" he said.

"As many readers of this blog like to point out, a virtual reality environment will never be a substitute for actually experiencing something.
No-one, even in the corridors of Oculus Connect, a conference for the virtual reality industry, would suggest otherwise.
Owned by Facebook, Oculus is credited with breathing new life into the virtual reality industry which had faded out after an almost cringe-worthy first-go in the nineties. Its headset, the Oculus Rift, hits shelves next year. Anticipation is huge.
But today we had a reminder of just how far we are from enjoying anything that comes even close to producing an fully-immersive world - one that can recreate common human feelings and emotions; the sense of being somewhere else, with other people, feeling different sensations.
Oculus and Facebook made a range of announcements relating to VR today. Here are the most significant:
To hammer this home, Oculus' chief scientist Michael Abrash took a refreshing approach to his keynote - outlining all the things Oculus could not yet do.
The problems are so great the team is not even trying to solve them - something for the next generation to tackle.
One is providing a sense of smell, a sensation so integral to experiencing, and later remembering, a new place.
Another challenge is the ability to taste something, or hear realistically in a way that does not feel as if we're just wearing headphones. Perhaps the biggest barrier is a sense of touch.
Haptic technology is only just beginning to recreate basic touch sensations - but it remains that in VR, it's going to be years before you'll stop putting your hand through virtual tables, killing the illusion in an instant.
But virtual reality enthusiasts shouldn't feel disheartened.
Right now, VR is what Space Invaders is to Call of Duty. They're both games, sure, but they're worlds apart. The now-primitive blip-blip-blip of 1970s arcade games were the building blocks needed to get us to where we are now.
And so the feeling among Oculus Connect is that this is just the beginning, and there's still a long way to go.
Gamers and the wider public may take a while to reach the same level of excitement felt within the industry.
Mr Abrash told delegates that they're living in the ""good old days"" of VR - a time that will be looked back upon as the start of something significant.
Except it's not quite the start. We've been here before. Journalists in the 1990s were writing about VR as the next big thing just as I am now. But the technology wasn't ready then.
Is it now? There are a few veterans prowling the halls here, enticed back to the action after some time away. One was Greg Panos, who has been studying virtual and augmented reality for over two decades.
I asked him if this latest wave of VR was any different to what happened in the 90s.
Yes, he said - the difference now is that VR is good enough, and cheap enough, for companies to start making some serious money. And so it starts.
The first battleground for VR will be gaming. Therefore the best games will win - in theory - so efforts from HTC Vive headset could disrupt Facebook's ambition. HTC has partnered with legendary games maker Valve, and so the games should be terrific. And the Vive goes on sale first.
Sony is jostling in, too. Its Morpheus headset has two things going for it. One, it's tied to the already immensely successful PlayStation 4, and so will likely be bundled with the console.
But with the announcements made today, Facebook is giving itself a huge headstart in a new, exciting world of entertainment.
Deals with Netflix and Minecraft could give Oculus the edge, even if other competitors have better hardware, as has been the suggestion. Content, as always, is king. Vive and Morpheus will need to compete with that.
The possibilities are mind-blowingly enormous - from gaming to tele-presence, education to blockbuster movies, Facebook is trying to nurture a platform that one day could rival the mobile app ecosystem in its scale.
But - and it's a big but - Facebook still needs to pull it off. One year on from Facebook's purchase of Oculus VR, we've still not seen the technology really hit the market in any meaningful way. That means Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg's $2bn bet in VR bet is still wide-open.
Will that purchase be seen as a shrewd move on par with Google's bargain-tactic $1.65bn purchase of YouTube in 2006?
Or will Oculus be Mr Zuckerberg's MySpace - a service with great early momentum, bought by NewsCorp for $580m, only to be later offloaded for $35m? It was a newcomer that took what MySpace started and made it much much better, killing the business in the process.
That newcomer being Facebook, of course, Mr Zuckerberg certainly knows how this game works.
It's presumably why he appeared, unannounced, at Thursday's event, seemingly with one key purpose - to manage the expectations of developers, the press and the public.
""All of you are inventing the next major platform,"" he told delegates. ""This is going to go very slowly.
""Facebook is committed to this for the long term.""
He doesn't expect ""millions"" of units to be sold - at least not for a while.
He was there to reassure developers that even if things don't pick up and make millionaires straight away, he's committed to sticking with it.
But he's not the only one - and it could be competitors that take what Oculus has started and does things better - giving Mr Zuckerberg the MySpace treatment.

"An all-party group has called on the UK government to consider devolving some immigration control.
That could involve Wales being able to set its own visas and migration quotas. And the group chairman said immigrants should have to learn English or Welsh.
The UK government said different rules for different areas would cause difficulties for employers.
Currently, there is no separate Welsh immigration policy.
A number of recommendations have made by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration (APPGSI) report on how the UK's immigration system could promote better integration.
It said speaking English was ""the key to full participation in our society and economy"".
Group chairman Chuka Umunna MP said he wanted Wales to have a bigger say in developing immigration policies.
""This is a really hot topic, it's become very toxic, very polarised and we want to build a consensus on what a new system could look like,"" he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme.
When asked if immigrants could learn Welsh if living and working in Wales as an alternative to English, he said: ""Absolutely. Why not?"", adding that people could not fully integrate in society if they could not speak the language.
David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth, called it a ""ludicrous idea"".
""People will just go to whichever nation... is offering the easiest visas and move to where they want to move to,"" he told BBC Wales.
""Once they've got a visa to go to Wales there will be nothing to stop them going to England or vice versa.""
The MPs' report claims the UK's existing points-based immigration system is ""generally unresponsive to demographic, economic and cultural differences between our constituent nations and regions"".
""Shaping immigration criteria to address nation or region-specific economic and cultural needs might instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area"", the study said.
It added: ""Enabling nations and regions to set regional immigration quotas would create new incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area.""
Devolution could involve the introduction of region-specific visas, with quotas for how many are issued.
Canada is given as an example, where all 10 provincial governments are allowed to set region-specific requirements for immigrants.
Immigrants are required to live in the region that approves their visa until they become eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship.
The province of Quebec is also able to set its own criteria for its visas and evaluate applications.
A small element of regional policy on immigration already exists in the UK, where Scotland has a list of occupations in addition to a UK-wide version where employers can advertise outside of the EU without first advertising domestically.
The UK government, the report said, should appoint an independent commission to explore how a devolved or regionally-led immigration system might work.
Questions for the commission could include extending existing powers for Scotland to Wales, Northern Ireland, London and the English metro regions, and whether the UK government might copy the Quebec model.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""It is important that the needs of Wales are reflected in future migration policies and that people who settle here are supported to integrate into communities.""
Plaid Cymru external affairs spokesman Steffan Lewis said: ""Plaid Cymru has long advocated a Welsh visa system to boost our public services such as the NHS and support the private sector in attracting high-skilled workers from around the world.
""It is also of great regret that Westminster policies have damaged our reputation as a destination for international students.
""Student visas should be devolved and would benefit our universities and our economy.""
A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Applying different immigration rules to different parts of the United Kingdom will complicate the immigration system, harming its integrity and causing difficulties for employers who need the flexibility to deploy their staff to other parts of the UK.""
She said the UK government was rolling out a Â£20m fund for English language provision and had made Â£140m available to councils to manage impacts on communities ""caused by issues such as poor English language skills"".
The spokeswoman added: ""We must also recognise that uncontrolled, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion and puts pressure on public services.
""Our priority is to build an immigration system that works for everyone in the UK and delivers the control we need.""","Immigration rules tailored to the needs of Wales could build public confidence in the system, a group of MPs has said.",38507803
"During the live stream the woman, who called herself Oceane, said she had been raped, before taking her own life on the tracks at Egly station 25 miles (40km) south of Paris.
Periscope, a popular social media app, has been used to chronicle unsuitable content before, including crimes and violence. Oceane's death has led to a fresh debate in France about how to regulate and protect young users of social media.
Woman 'live-streamed her suicide on Periscope'
It is a sad consequence that this young woman, who wanted her death witnessed by so many strangers, is now the subject of such intense scrutiny. Her phone examined by police; her last moments spooled back from video surveillance cameras at the scene; her story, her life, her remains pored over by investigators, politicians, journalists, and of course the social media audience she pulled into her own death.
It's like putting a Ferrari in the hands of a five-year-old. Obviously it's going to slam into a wall""
Amid the shock at her death in France, those commentators and journalists are beginning to unpick the role Periscope might have played in her decision, and whether more could have been done to help her.
Many make the point that, just like a knife or a hammer, it is not social media itself that is dangerous, but how it is used.
Others say the medium itself, where the goal is to accumulate friends and followers, encourages exhibitionism.
Twitter, which owns Periscope, said it had removed the content but did not comment on individual accounts.
Justine Atlan, president of e-Enfance which campaigns for more child protection online, is in no doubt that sites like Periscope are dangerous, and asks whether Oceane would have taken her own life if she had not been able to stream it live.
""It's like putting a Ferrari in the hands of a five-year-old,"" she told radio station France Info. ""Obviously it's going to slam into a wall. What happened is extremely serious and, unfortunately, extremely predictable.""
Xavier Pommereau, a psychiatrist at Bordeaux hospital, agreed that sites such as Periscope could possibly push someone to commit suicide, because ""streaming amplifies the resonance of a phenomenon"".
Another psychologist, Michael Stora, believes part of the problem is the responsibility placed on the person's friends or followers on social media apps, otherwise known as moderation by your peers.
""On Facebook you can say 'I want to die' and you ask your friends to intervene and become psychologists,"" he told Atlantico website.  ""We don't talk about it much, but there are a huge number of people who talk about their morbid thoughts, even if they don't necessarily act.""
Fabrice Mattatia, an expert in digital trust and a former government adviser on digital issues, says the lines of responsibility are sometimes hard to discern.
""Internet users who watched the events could possibly face legal action for not assisting a person in danger, but the intention of the subject must be clear and the spectators must have time to realise the intention and call the police.""
Limiting the spread of these videos, and with it the incentive to use them in this way, is one way to curb the threat, says Fabrice Mattatia. But websites and apps also need to develop alert systems that either do not exist or are little known.
""Periscope has an email address for emergencies, it seems, but do users know it? Is it easy to find?""
That is the conclusion reached by the well-known digital magazine Numerama, which says sites like Periscope urgently need an ""emergency button"" to allow users to send information to the police and emergency services.
""This issue emerged when people started filming attacks or other crimes on Periscope,"" it says. ""It's all the more urgent for suicide cases like this.""
Monitoring what happens on social media is a tricky question for France, in the fight again terrorism as well as in cases of crime, or personal tragedy.
""I've heard young people say very disturbing things in the name of freedom of speech,"" says Michael Stora, ""but freedom only exists within a framework, and here there's no longer a framework - we are in a crazy place.""

"Ron Stone has been described as a ""true champion"" of St George West, the ward he had represented on Bristol City Council since 1985.
The leader of the Labour group at the council, Helen Holland, said: ""Ron will be remembered as a steadfast campaigner and committed socialist.""
Mr Stone died aged 73 on Wednesday.
Ms Holland said he was ""dedicated to furthering social justice and equality in Bristol and beyond"".
She added: ""The Labour Party has lost one of its most committed councillors.
""Bristol is a better city because of Ron Stone's unwavering public service.""
The city's mayor, George Ferguson, said Mr Stone had ""an undying passion for Bristol"".
""I always enjoyed his directness and wry humour - even when directed at me.
""As a councillor for St George West for 30 years, Ron had a vast knowledge of his neighbourhood and the people he served, making him an excellent ward councillor who made a real difference.
""With his keen sense of social justice, Ron made an enormous contribution to life in Bristol. He was an 'establishment rebel', always without his civic robes but seldom without his camera, recording people and events.""

"John Collins, 74, Terry Perkins, 67, Brian Reader, 76, and Daniel Jones, 58, pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court.
Items believed to be worth more than Â£10m were taken in the raid at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London's jewellery quarter.
More than 70 safety deposit boxes were ransacked.
Perkins, of Heene Road, Enfield, Collins, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, Jones, of Park Avenue, Enfield and Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, were arrested in May.
They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle, namely to enter Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London with intent to steal, between 1 January and 7 April.
The four men also faced a charge of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property, but the prosecution said they would not pursue the charge in light of the men's guilty pleas in relation to the conspiracy to burgle charge.
Earlier this month a law firm confirmed the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit had gone into liquidation as the company was insolvent and ""owes money to companies and people"".
The men will be sentenced at a date to be confirmed.
After the burglary, the Met Police launched an investigation into why after police were made aware an intruder alarm had gone off at the scene of the raid it was decided the alarm did not require a response.
The force apologised for not following procedures and said it would investigate why the call was given a grade that meant no police response was deemed necessary.
Five other men still face trial accused of conspiring to commit the burglary, a charge they deny.
Hugh Doyle, 48, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield, north London; William Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, east London; and John Harbinson, 42, of Beresford Gardens, Benfleet, Essex, all also deny the laundering offence and are due to stand trial in November.
Paul Reader, 50, of Dartford Road, Dartford, and Carl Wood, 58, of Elderbeck Close, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, are yet to enter pleas.
Perkins' daughters also appeared in court, along with their husbands, accused of conspiracy to convert or transfer criminal property between 1 January and 19 May.
Brenn Walters, also known as Ben Perkins, 43, and Laura Perkins, 40, both of Manor Court, Enfield, north London, and Terri Robinson, 35, and Steven Robinson, 46, both of Sterling Road, Enfield, were charged in connection with the raid last month.",Four men have admitted conspiracy to burgle in connection with the Hatton Garden safety deposit box raid over the Easter weekend.,34153995
"In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013.
The figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB).
The ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases.
The board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34%.
There had also been a fall of 54% in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said.
In recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63%, the ALB said.
But last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the ""sloppy practice"" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options.
President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about ""resource issues"" affecting local authorities' thinking.
He said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services  in support of the case for adoption.
ALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been ""entirely sensible"".
But he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed.
He told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child.
""It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court,"" he said.
Sir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then ""that will do"", when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued.
Sir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting.
The number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to  5,050 in the last year.
The recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England  has prompted  Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements.
""It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements.
""So I am pleased to produce this simple myth-busting guide - drafted by a senior queen's counsel - to what those judgements do and do not say.
""I am extremely grateful to Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, for his advice. He has seen the document and is supportive of its aim of dispelling the myths that have arisen.""
Messages included in Sir Martin's guidance reiterated that the legal test for adoption had not changed, and courts must be provided with expert, high quality, evidence-based analysis of all realistic options for a child and the arguments for and against each of these.
Sir Martin said: ""The board and I have published this guide to help everyone working for children understand the law around these complex cases, and be confident in making the right decisions for the child.""","The number of children put forward for adoption by local councils in England has fallen by almost half in under a year, the latest figures show.",30002988
"Some argue that Africans have never had so much artistic freedom, with a proliferation of books, paintings and films since the advent of multi-party democracy in the 1990s, and the huge advance in technology which has allowed anyone with a smartphone to publish their views across the world.
But critics say artists are still subject to tight censorship, pointing out that a South African gallery was forced to remove a painting of President Jacob Zuma under political pressure, while in Uganda a play about gay rights was banned.
So, just how free are Africa's artists - in film, literature and music- to tell their own stories? Here are some of their experiences:
Having been born and raised in Uganda, it was the best place to be. It was my home and my everything.
I remember joining the film industry in 1999 - everything was still good. You didn't need a licence to shoot a film, no censor body to look at your script.
All you had to do was get a camera, run to the streets, shoot something and lock yourself in the edit suite - and later put your work out there for the world to see.
Today, I have grown to understand that not all stories can be told and not just any film can be done here.
There are topics you have to think twice before tackling or which, for your safety, are better left untold. Topics that will get even actors saying: ""I think I am not the right person for that role"" even when you know they can pull it off.
Here, you don't just wake up to say you are doing a film about the gay community, a film about the political situation, or a film that paints a bad picture of Uganda.
One day I had to drop a story that was inspired by the practice of female genital mutilation amongst some communities in Uganda.
I had strong interviews and had done thorough research, but everyone kept telling me it was not safe to go ahead. But it is still my home, my Uganda, my everything.
I don't think anyone is free to exercise their art. And that includes artists.
There is a cost for this freedom. Artists are no different to the entrepreneur in that financial resources are required for the capital outlay of the ""work"" or manuscript.
Just to be in a position to indulge in the work is time spent creating a product without the immediate benefit of financial return.
Then the work needs to be produced depending upon the format and genre, requiring additional resources.
In the case of a writer, it is then given to a publisher, who spends even more resources to fine-tune the manuscript with an editor, proof reader, type setter, graphic designer etc. which could take considerable time before it is placed on the retail shelf.
Since the work now becomes a joint investment, compromise is inevitable. So, I guess artists are free to tell their story if they have the resources to indulge in this freedom.
There is a preconceived notion and expectations regarding African films. Only in recent years have young filmmakers begun to break the mould and make more experimental films.
Funders have a clear idea of the African films they want. In most instances, those that depict African people in an unconventional light are not the stories funders and international festivals want to see.
They are content to see Africa as a struggling continent, which is corrupt and disease-ridden.
Many urban African stories don't ever reach beyond Africa because of the question: ""Are those really African stories?"".
The image and perception of African film is still very narrow.
I want to tell African fantasy and surreal films, but the reaction is: ""Why? Don't you have more important issues that you need to address in your films?""
Each African film-maker has his own story to tell and we need to allow the ""strange for Africa"" films to co-exist with those that speak of identity, cultural and moral injustices, war, HIV/Aids etc.
But things have changed slightly and filmmakers are finding alternative sources of funding - for instance, private investors - to tell stories they are passionate about.
Are artists free to tell their own stories? This is a conscious choice each artist has to make.
However, in the developing world, with most artists relying solely on their practice for their livelihood, they are forced to compromise their genuine stories with some ""fabricated reality"" that is sellable.
This is further fuelled by the common perception that sales equal success, which leaves us caught up in creating fairy tales for sale.
In oppressive environments, artists are intimidated and live in fear of censorship or consequences of defiance.
In Kenya, having recently switched from the stereotypical African dictatorship that clamped down on creatives (mostly writers) to a more liberal government, artists whose work was inspired by bad governance, stemming from from semi-illiterate leadership, now have trouble remaining relevant.

Africa Debate
The whole funding situation further complicates the scenario.
There's a big chunk of ""development"" aid and ""human rights"" funding channelled through non-governmental organisations.
A handful of very prolific artists have gone mercenary. They've stopped making good art and have started championing the causes of civil society groups because the money is good.
Artists are very free to tell their stories. A lot of factors may determine whether they do but in spaces with rampant poverty, very few can resist the temptation of a fistful of dollars to tell someone else's story.
Artists just have to believe that their own stories are good enough.
Filmmakers, unlike other artists such as painters and dancers, need money to practice their craft.
And African filmmakers are especially burdened by a lack of money because our societies are financially strapped and they historically undervalue art.
Our governments have different priorities and our businessmen see no financial value in supporting art.
So African artists often find it impossible to tell their own stories.
One way around that difficulty, I find, is crowd-funding. With many people making small donations, an artist can raise enough money to see through a vision that would otherwise be impossible to realise.
That is how I completed my debut feature, Ninah's Dowry. But the lack of a speedy internet structure and limited access to credit cards still make crowd-funding a challenge on the continent.
Another not-so-obvious deterrent to an artist's freedom is the requirement by some governments that artists submit scripts for approval before filming permits are granted.
It is understandable for my beloved Cameroon, for example, to be touchy about military sites appearing onscreen. That is a credible national security issue.
But, what happens if the artist's screenplay is critical of his government or country?
Belonging to a very traditional society with conservative cultural values, I always have to make sure that what I say or what I do does not offend certain sensitivities. Which is not easy when you realise that the Festival in the Desert, while looking outward to the modern world, is organised by an indigenous people from a very traditionalist milieu.
With the occupation of a large part of Mali and the prohibition of any form of artistic expression such as music, things became much more difficult.
Expression itself was extremely risky because you exposed yourself to various punishments from the occupiers - including imprisonment.
Even on the international level, to denounce what was happening could bring you trouble.
At first you may be labelled as ""an enemy of Islam"" with all that implies in consequences for your daily life.
However, this does not intimidate us because we are convinced that what we do is not against Islam.
Our struggle is to show the values that are held by the majority of Muslims in the world, values of sharing and of tolerance.
In its comparatively short history, African cinema has been viewed with considerable apathy and condescension both at home and abroad.
No post-colonial African state in the continent has attempted to develop a cultural or film policy that incorporates critical debates, political and the poetic, since former Senegalese President Leopold Senghor's 1960s attempt with his idea of ""Negritude"".
With funding intertwined in various governmental departments and international development resources, film-makers are often forced to avoid making films dealing with their immediate surroundings.
Instead, they produce films that are neither critical of social problems and national politics nor entertaining.
That said, digital storytelling has presented film-makers with essential tools to battle for the freedom to create and distribute their work.
In the last 10 years, young Africans have brought amazing energy to drama by embracing digital technology and therefore producing work that has been able to reach its audience across multiple platforms providing film-makers the freedom to imagine and free from the global hegemony.","Fespaco, Africa's premiere film festival, is taking place in Burkina Faso this week, amid debate about artistic freedom on the continent.",21573953
"The Cambridge University Library has housed the Codex Zacynthius since 1984.
It was offered first refusal to buy the New Testament manuscript and had until the end of August to find the funds.
The fate of the historical text had been in doubt after the Bible Society in Swindon, which owned it for almost 200 years, decided to sell it off to raise money.
The society, which was presented with the 176-page volume in 1821, wanted to shore up funds for a new £1m visitor centre inside a deconsecrated church in North Wales.
Dr Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury who supported the Cambridge University Library's fundraising campaign, said securing the text would allow further study.
The bible features an early seventh century script which has been partially scraped away and written over to make way for a 13th century entry.
It is regarded as an important text in studying the development of the New Testament.
""The discovery and identification of the under-text represents a fascinating detective story,"" Dr Williams said.
""By securing the manuscript, we hope that multispectral imaging techniques will enable scholars to recover fully the hidden text.""",Scholars have hit their target of raising £1.1m to secure the future of an early Biblical manuscript.,29170020
"Josh Vela fired Bolton in front from eight yards after Emile Heskey laid Dean Moxey's long throw into his path.
But Boro equalised when Rhodes, who was about to be replaced by David Nugent, drilled home from close range.
Rhodes then headed in Middlesbrough's second stoppage-time winner this week from three yards.
Minutes earlier, Boro's big-money transfer deadline day signing from Blackburn had hit the post and headed wide from six yards as the Teessiders sought a winner, while substitute Gaston Ramirez also scooped a shot over from close range.
Relive Middlesbrough's win at Bolton
But Rhodes was in the right place at the right time to nod in Nugent's cross in the first minute of injury time and leave Boro two points clear at the top after promotion rivals Burnley, who they face on Tuesday, won 2-1 at Birmingham.
Boro, who have now won six successive games, also scored an injury-time winner to beat Reading in midweek and this late show secured only their second victory at Bolton's current home.
Middlesbrough face promotion rivals Burnley and Brighton in their closing four games and, as such, have their fate in their own hands as they bid to return to the Premier League for the first time since 2009.
Aitor Karanka's side dominated the first half in terms of chances as Stewart Downing hit the bar from 25 yards, while Adam Forshaw, Daniel Ayala, Albert Adomah and Ritchie de Laet all failed to hit to target.
Mark Davies' backheel forced Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos into a save from Bolton's best first-half opening.
Wanderers looked set for only their fifth win of the season after Vela put them in front but Rhodes had the final say to the delight of Boro's 4,302 travelling fans.
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka:
""I told him [Rhodes] after the game that a goalscorer can't forget to score goals in two months.
""Always one day it would arrive that he would score goals and it was today - two important goals.
""I don't think it's been easy for him. He's not a strong character, you can see it in his face. The reason I am pleased for him is because sometimes when you do your best and you're unlucky you are going down. He was always trusting himself.
""Today, the most important day, he arrived and he was there to help the team.""
Bolton interim manager Jimmy Phillips:
""That's [the level of performance] got to be the case from now until the end of the season.
""We encourage players to get on the ball, show as much in possession as they could, to be confident with it, because our league fate has been decided but also retaining a real competitive edge and defensive shape.
""There's still areas to work on, definitely, hopefully if we can achieve better ball retention, become harder to beat and still work hard that will set the players up for next season for those that are going to be here.""

Poysden, who was already tied to Edgbaston to the end of 2017, has worked with the England Lions at the National Cricket Centre in Loughborough this autumn and is currently with the Lions squad at their training camp in Dubai.
He has made 16 one-day and 19 T20 appearances for the Bears since initially joining on trial after leaving Cambridge University ahead of the 2014 season.
He also made a late-season breakthrough in the County Championship this summer, taking 15 wickets in his five appearances, including a career-best 5-53 against champions Middlesex at Edgbaston.
Former Staffordshire player Mellor, who first joined the Bears at the end of the 2015 season on a one-year deal, has now signed a new two-year contract.

"It comes days after IS was pushed out of the nearby ancient city of Palmyra.
IS captured al-Qaryatain in August, and abducted hundreds of residents, including dozens of Christians. Many were later freed.
A monitoring group said there were still pockets of fighting in the town.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday there were still IS fighters in the eastern parts of the town, but that they were withdrawing.
If the government reasserts its control over al-Qaryatain, it would be a further boost for President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces - backed by Russian air strikes - have made a string of gains against rebels in recent months.
The capture of the town would also provide a central base for government troops and their allies to attack IS-held areas near the Iraqi border, observers say.
A Syrian army general said troops had ""restored security and stability to al-Qaryatain and farms surrounding it"" and would cut off IS supply routes between the east and the Qalamoun mountains region in the west.
Al-Qaryatain, about 80km (50 miles) west of Palmyra, was taken over by IS fighters in their first major offensive since they seized Palmyra last May.
The mixed city had a large Christian population, many of whom fled, though dozens were abducted and reportedly taken to IS' de facto capital, Raqqa. They were released weeks later, reports said.
There has been a dramatic drop in fighting in Syria since a partial ceasefire came into effect last month, though IS and the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front were excluded and are still being targeted.","Syrian forces and their allies have retaken the central town of al-Qaryatain from so-called Islamic State (IS), dealing a further strategic blow to the militant group, state media say.",35957942
"The hosts saw left-back Alex Telles dismissed after two bookings in a 74-second spell, the second after a wild sliding tackle on Stephan Lichtsteiner on 27 minutes.
His side spent long spells in their own half and survived a Paulo Dybala strike against the post before the interval.
But Juve - who had 77% possession - broke through when Pjaca drove low into the net five minutes after coming on and Alves finished from six yards 80 seconds after his own introduction.
The goals ensured Juve's fourth successive 2-0 win on the road in all competitions and their advantage now looks huge ahead of the return on 14 March. Other than a penalty shootout defeat to Inter Milan in December, the last time the Old Lady lost on home soil was in August 2015.
In Porto the Italian side were bettering possession when Telles lost control, first fouling Juan Cuadrado before hacking Lichtsteiner down with no apparent danger. The left-back was clearly emotional as he walked to the tunnel with his shirt covering much of his face.
It allowed Juve to totally dominate, though Nuno Espírito Santo's side improved after the break and looked like they may hold out, deploying a compact 4-4-1 formation to stifle the Serie A leaders.
But with the game in its final quarter, Pjaca benefited from a ricochet off Miguel Layun - who came on at left-back after Telles' dismissal - to slam his first goal since joining the club in July past Iker Casillas.
Alves chested down Alex Sandro's delivery and hooked in on 74 minutes to tighten Juve's grip. Massimiliano Allegri's side hold a seven-point lead at the summit of Italy's top tier and remain undefeated in the Champions League, increasing their hopes of a first win in the competition since 1996.

"The new Manchester City striker headed the Elephants in front from a right-wing cross by Max Gradel.
Hilal Soudani equalised for Algeria against the run of play early in the second half and then forced goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo into a brilliant save.
Gbohouo was rewarded when Bony headed in Yaya Toure's free-kick and Junior Tallo set up Gervinho for a late third.
The margin of victory flattered Ivory Coast in what was an even contest and before former Arsenal striker Gervinho confirmed the result on the break, they had been under pressure from Algeria.
Their defence seemed all over the place at times and semi-final opponents DR Congo will have taken note.
Algeria, in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2010, made the brighter start to the contest and almost went ahead in the ninth minute.
Yacine Brahimi raced into the left-hand side of the penalty area and the Elephants' defence failed to deal with his cross, allowing Soudani to get in a shot which was well held by Gbohouo.
In the 21st minute, Riyad Mahrez volleyed over from close range but then Ivory Coast hit back.
Two minutes later, Gradel floated in a free-kick from the left and Serge Aurier's downward header hit the base of the post and then in the 26th minute they took the lead.
Gradel was again involved as he delivered a testing cross from the right and Bony escaped the defence to head home from eight yards.
Bony shot wide from distance towards the end of the first half before at the other end, Saphir Taider's sharp volley was confidently saved by Gbohouo.
The start of the second half mirrored the start of the first with one team dominating but the other one scoring.
This time Ivory Coast were the team who started on top but a comedy of errors in their defence after a deep cross into their penalty area finally saw the ball fall to Soudani, who fired it home.
That sparked a spell of dominance from the Desert Foxes with Gbohouo twice having to clear his lines before he made an amazing 66th minute save from Soudani's point-blank effort.
The momentum changed and two minutes later Bony restored Ivory Coast's lead when he climbed highest to head Yaya Toure's set-piece inside the near post.

"Sunni Muslim Tanveer Ahmed, 32, from Bradford in Yorkshire, stabbed 40-year-old Asad Shah outside his store in Shawlands on 24 March.
Ahmed had said he killed the shopkeeper because he had posted videos online in which he claimed to be a prophet.
The killer was told he would serve a minimum of 27 years in prison.
Mr Shah was an Ahmadi, a minority sect not recognised by all Muslims.
Why was Asad Shah murdered?
Last month, Ahmed had pleaded guilty to the religiously-motivated murder at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
Jailing him for life at the same court, judge Lady Rae told Ahmed: ""This was a barbaric, premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much loved man who was a pillar of the local community.
""He was described as a peaceful and peace-loving man and family man who went out of his way to show respect for those of any faith.""
The judge branded the attack as ""an appalling display of merciless violence"".
Lady Rae added: ""No-one in any civilised country including Scotland has the right to take the life of another whatever offence that individual perceives that he or she has suffered.
""It is vitally important in modern society that respect and tolerance for others of any race, creed, colour, ethnic origin or religious belief is maintained and protected by the law of the land.
""I note with considerable concern that you have expressed no remorse whatsoever for this appalling crime.""
As Ahmed was being led to the cells to begin his sentence, he shouted to his family and friends in the public gallery in what is believed to be Arabic and they chanted back at him.
The court previously heard that Mr Shah was an Ahmadi who differ from the majority of Muslims, including Sunni Muslims, in that they believe the Prophet Muhammad was not the final Prophet.
The majority of Muslims believe Muhammad was the final Prophet and say any other view is inconsistent with Islamic belief.
Ahmed, a Sunni, claimed that he had killed Mr Shah because he had posted videos online in which the shopkeeper had ""disrespected"" Islam by claiming to be a prophet.
Ahmed watched a clip featuring Mr Shah on his mobile phone as he travelled to Glasgow on the day of the murder and was heard in a phone message to say ""listen to this guy, something needs to be done, it needs nipped in the bud"".
When he arrived at the shop, Ahmed said he warned Mr Shah that he was there to kill him and asked him to stop claiming to be a prophet.
CCTV footage of the attack showed Ahmed pulling a knife out and moving behind the counter and stabbing Mr Shah repeatedly.
The shopkeeper managed to get outside, but was stabbed again and then stamped on and kicked in a frenzied attack as he lay dying in the street.
Mr Shah's brother Athar Shah tried to intervene, but was unable to fend off Ahmed.
As Mr Shah lay dying on the ground, Ahmed walked calmly to a bus shelter where police found him a short time later.
After being arrested, Ahmed released a statement through his lawyer saying he had killed Mr Shah as he had falsely claimed to be a prophet.
After Ahmed was jailed, Ch Supt Brian McInulty, of Police Scotland, said: ""I hope that the sentencing today will reassure the immediate community in Glasgow's south-side as well as communities all across Scotland that acts of violence such as this are utterly unacceptable and cannot be justified.
""Glasgow is a strong, united, multi-faith community that has immense pride in its diversity.
""Religious intolerance in any form is simply not tolerated in our society and Police Scotland will work in partnership with our communities to eradicate such behaviour.""
The Shah family moved to Scotland from Pakistan in the 1990s to escape persecution over their beliefs.
No members of Mr Shah's family were in court to hear the sentence imposed, but friends were in the public gallery.
A victim impact statement written by Mr Shah's sister Attia on behalf of Mr Shah's family said: ""Our pain goes beyond our vocabulary. We have tried, in an inevitably inadequate way to capture the feelings and emotions that no person should ever have to do.
""One of the most tangible and far-reaching consequences of this tragedy is that, as a family, whilst our bond will last forever, we have fragmented and many of us have or are in the process of leaving Scotland, in search of a new life, away from the memories we used to cherish but are now the source of immense pain and suffering.""
The statement said Mr Shah's widow has been ""brutally deprived of a life and companionship with her soul-mate and kindred spirit, the love of her life"".","A man has been jailed for life after he admitted the religiously-motivated murder of a Glasgow shopkeeper who he claimed had ""disrespected"" Islam.",37021385

The music director of Baltimore Symphony Orchestra since 2007, and principal conductor of Brazil's Sao Paulo Symphony Orchestra, she has been hailed for her bold attempts to make classical music more inclusive, defying boundaries of class, age and gender.
The day after conducting Britain's best-loved musical extravaganza in front of a crowd of more than 6,000, Alsop spoke to the BBC about the Proms, patriotism, and those pink balloons.
You appeared visibly moved at last night's performance, was it what you expected?
It exceeded my expectations. It was a great evening. It was really emotional and very moving to be involved in such a big celebration.
What makes the Proms such a unique event in the world of classical music?
I think it's the number of people that gather and watch, from the parks and that. Everyone comes with the expectation that it's going to be great evening and it's so nice to have everyone coming from such a positive vantage point.
Speaking at the Proms last night, you alluded to opposition you faced to becoming a conductor, tell me more about that.
When I was a kid my violin teacher told me girls couldn't do that. She simply didn't see it.
To a certain degree I have met opposition, spoken or unspoken, all the way through. I think every woman in a position of authority will tell you that opposition exists somewhere in the mix, whether it's conscious or unconscious, because we're not accustomed as a society [to having a female in charge].
Does gender make any difference to the role of conductor?
I have no idea if being female makes any difference. I have no perspective on it, I have only been me.
Could it affect the relationship between conductor and orchestra?
Not at all.  I think the orchestra just wants someone knowledgeable and committed. They don't really care, as long as you're good.
How much time did you have to rehearse with the BBC symphony orchestra?
We didn't have that much time. We started rehearsing Thursday afternoon - just two days. It makes it very exciting.
The Proms finale is traditionally very patriotic. As an American, how did it feel to be at the centre of it?
I feel very much at home here, I like all the tradition and that kind of hoopla.
So you don't think we are a bunch of flag-waving loons?
I didn't say that...! But I enjoy it. I think there is something very dear about it all.
What about the pink balloons which were tied around the hall, were they for your benefit?
I assume so - they said 'it's a girl!'
Nigel Kennedy burst one with his bow right in front of you. How was your first experience of working with him?
The balloon was a little bit alarming. It was fun to work together, we really enjoyed it. I thought we had a great rapport, a great connection.
Would you consider replicating the Proms in Baltimore or Sao Paulo?
This is a uniquely British experience. Imitating things doesn't necessarily bring out the best.
It's the morning after the night before and you are en route back to the States. Where do you find the energy?
I don't have much of it this morning. I am hoping to regroup on the plane.
What do you do to relax?
I love to run, work out a little bit, read, I'm studying Portugueseâ€¦ I've got a full plate.
Do you listen to music, or is that too much like work?
Absolutely not.
What do you see as your legacy?
I don't care much about legacies. To me it's all about trying to maximise whatever you are doing in the moment, and make a difference wherever you are.",This weekend saw New Yorker Marin Alsop become the first woman to lead the Last Night of the Proms in its 118-year history.,24008355

The tribe had planned on opening a lounge selling marijuana - for consumption only in the lounge - on New Year's Eve.
""We just felt it would be best to go in with a clean slate to look for answers on how to proceed so that all sides are comfortable with it,"" said Flandreau Santee Sioux President Anthony Reider, adding that burning the crop was ""in the best interest of both tribal and non-tribal members.""
The 400-person tribe, which already runs a casino, hotel and ranch, had predicted the marijuana sales would make up to $2m (Â£1.3m) per month.
The lounge would have had games, food and a bar, and eventually a live music venue and slot machines.
In September Mr Reider said he wanted it to be ""an adult playground"".","Fearing a federal raid, a South Dakota Native American tribe is burning its marijuana crop, which it had planned to sell in a resort on its land.",34780041

"If Prime Minister Theresa May does not appear to have had a particularly good night, Ruth Davidson, the Tory leader in Scotland, certainly has.
The Scottish Tories have seen double-digit increases in their vote in almost every seat. They've more than doubled their returns in some places where the party was previously unelectable.
First they knocked off Angus Robertson, the SNP's deputy leader and top dog at Westminster.
They had called that their ""Portillo moment"" - but their best was yet to come, as they dethroned Alex Salmond in Gordon. They even overturned the fourth-safest seat in the country, in Banff and Buchan.
Other Scottish Tory gains include:
It's been a long time since the Tories have had a night like this in Scotland.
In four elections in a row, they returned a single MP. The year before that, 1997, they got zero. You have to go back to 1992 for the last time they won more than a single seat in Scotland.
They ended up with 13 - the party's best showing north of the border since 1983.
What this Tory resurgence means for the rest of the UK in terms of parliamentary calculations is unclear. The margins are razor-thin, so every seat is precious.
But the Tories are resolute in what they believe it means for Scotland.
""Indyref2 is dead,"" Ms Davidson says. The prospect of a second independence referendum has been at the core of the Tory campaign, and indeed their entire revival in Scotland.
The SNP have a majority of seats, and thus a ""triple lock"" mandate for that referendum, according to their manifesto - but it certainly seems a more distant prospect than ever.
And while Mrs May's future might now be in doubt, Ms Davidson's star is burning more brightly than ever.",Election night has turned out to be a night of contrasting fortunes for the Conservative and Unionist Party.,40210331

"The ""twisted light"" approach relies on what is called light's orbital angular momentum, which has been put forth as an unexploited means to carry data.
Now a number of researchers, including some formally commenting in New Journal of Physics, say the idea is misguided.
Responding in the same journal, the approach's proponents insist the idea can in time massively boost data rates.
That promise is an enticing one for telecommunications firms that are running out of ""space"" in the electromagnetic spectrum, which is increasingly crowded with allocations for communications, broadcast media and data transmission.
So others are weighing in on what could be a high-stakes debate.
""This would be worth a Nobel prize, if they're right. Can you imagine, if all communications could be done on one frequency?"" asked Bob Nevels of Texas A&M University, a former president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' Antennas and Propagation Society.
""If they've got such a great thing, why isn't everyone jumping up and down? Because we know it won't work,"" he told BBC News.
The disagreement in New Journal of Physics provides a window on the time-honoured practice of open debate in academic journals (as opposed to the increasingly widespread approach of debating issues before they are even formally published): a kind of ""he says, she says"" with references.
The principle behind the idea is fairly simple. Photons, the most basic units of light, carry two kinds of momentum, a kind of energy-of-motion.
One, spin angular momentum, is better known as polarisation. Photons ""wiggle"" along a particular direction, and different polarisations can be separated out by, for example, polarising sunglasses or 3D glasses.
But they also carry orbital angular momentum - in analogy to the Earth-Sun system, the spin angular momentum is expressed in our planet spinning around its axis, while the orbital angular momentum manifests as our revolution around the Sun.
The new technique aims to exploit this orbital angular momentum, essentially encoding more data as a ""twist"" in the light waves.
That the phenomenon exists is not in question - it has been put to use recently in studying black holes, for example.
What makes the current debate devilishly complex is arguing whether experiments by Bo Thide of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and colleagues really do use and benefit from it.
The team has carried out very public demonstrations of the idea, sending data across a Venice lagoon in a test first described in a New Journal of Physics article. But even before that article made it to press, other researchers were questioning the approach's validity.
In a paper in IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, Lund University's Ove Edfors and Anders Johansson argued that what was going on was a version of ""multiple input, multiple output"" - or Mimo - data transmission, a technique first outlined in the 1970s.
""I've been trying to have a discussion with these guys, asking for arguments - because all the arguments they have put forward have been perfectly explainable by standard theories,"" Prof Edfors told BBC News.
""What I get back is 'you don't understand, you're not a physicist', and I say 'well, try to convince me'.""
Julien Perruisseau-Carrier at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL), and colleagues make much the same argument in their comment paper published this week. But it seems clear that the controversy arises as a conflict between the disciplines of physics and engineering.
""These people are physicists, they have their own research,"" Prof Perruisseau-Carrier told BBC News. ""But the authors are trying to spin off some of their work into a telecommunications issue.
""The fact is they didn't understand that what they were doing, as we explained, is a subset of something very well-known and documented.""
Detractors argue that the demonstrations so far have only used two ""modes"" to transmit information, perfectly replicating a Mimo setup - and that if Prof Thide and colleagues try to extend the work - to the promised tens or hundreds of possible modes, they will fail.
For his part, Prof Thide insists that it is the engineers who have misunderstood.
""The typical wireless engineer, even if a professor, doesn't know anything about angular momentum,"" he told BBC News.
""The points made by these people... are in contradiction to each and every textbook there is in electrodynamics. This is not something invented by us, something we found out on a coffee break - this is on solid theoretical foundations going back through several Nobel prizes.""
But the groundswell of resistance to the technique seems to be growing. Prof Nevels and his Texas A&M colleague Laszlo Kish have published a paper in PLOS ONE that they believe is the simple, final proof of its impossibility - and more academics are signing on as co-authors.
Prof Perruisseau-Carrier says that the idea will prove itself valid or otherwise soon enough.
""They mentioned they have some contact with telecoms companies - we were very happy to see that. There's no doubt that as soon as they defer to a real expert, that people will notice [that the idea is flawed],"" he said.
""We are convinced that this will not go anywhere.""",An idea to vastly increase the carrying capacity of radio and light waves has been called into question.,20217938
"I've previously blogged about the strategy's controversial plans to create banning orders for extremist groups.
Prime Minister David Cameron wants to go further than create new punitive powers and, like his predecessor Tony Blair, reset the public debate on community cohesion and society's duty in combating all extremism.
The government has already introduced two fundamental changes to how it wants to prevent violent extremism.
Ministers have already cut funding to Muslim groups whom they suspect of harbouring views that are anathema to a liberal open democracy.
Secondly, public bodies including schools and universities are now under a duty to prevent people being drawn into extremism.
Mr Cameron now argues that fighting extremism demands a greater response from society by finding ways to intervene before someone has gone down the road that leads to violence - and his plans were first set out in July.
He argued that his starting point was that the UK was ""a successful, multi-racial, multi-faith democracy"" to which Muslims had made a ""profound contribution"". They and wider society, he said, now need to dismantle the component parts of extremist ideology.
This is easier said than done.
For instance, the prime minister said he wants the government to work with and use people who understand the true nature of so-called Islamic State to prevent younger people listening to its recruitment sergeants.
The government is talking about new specific deradicalisation programmes and ""empowering"" the UK's Syrians, Iraqis and Kurds to take a lead role in speaking out.
How exactly they plan to do this remains unclear - not least because there are very few people who are qualified to carry out deradicalisation work. The recent case of a Blackburn teenager who plotted terrorism on the other side of the world shows how such work can ultimately be in vain.
The elephant in the room is, of course, the internet. Ministers are trying to persuade social media companies to spend more of their dotcom millions on crushing extremism. Many of these firms  think there is only so much they can do when ISIS recruits continually relaunch themselves online under a new guise.
Ministers are talking about social media bans for extremist preachers - but research shows that militants spread the message through innovative ways that are harder to stop.
The government wants to create powers to curtail the activity of ""extremists"", even if they don't break hate laws or incite violence.
Ministers argue that these people provide succour to those who want to use violence.
One of the plans is to create powers to close ""mosques"" where extremists meet. Just putting aside the anecdotal evidence that recruitment regularly happens anywhere but the mosque, this idea was in fact first proposed 10 years ago by Tony Blair.
And what that tells us is some of these proposals will ultimately come down to a fight over how to define extremism in an open society - and whether a policy aspiration can become clear and workable law. Expect serious legal fireworks in Parliament and in the courts for years to come.
Minister say extremists are overpowering normal Muslim voices.
The strategy is full of pitfalls.
Back in January two ministers, the Muslim peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon and the then communities secretary Eric Pickles, wrote to imams in the wake of the Paris attacks. Critics within the community said the letter amounted to an accusation that Muslims were ""inherently apart"" from British society.
The ministers believe the letter was taken the wrong way - not least because it said quite explicitly that Muslim and British values were the same.
Today's plan to throw Â£5m over the next six months at groups prepared to join government in combating militants is likely to face some of the same critics - but it will also be welcomed by many community organisations who are crying out for funding and support to challenge extremism where they find it.
David Cameron says he wants a more cohesive society - but that's terribly difficult to define and back-up in policy.
For instance, in July he said there would be a review of how immigrants learn English.
On the very same day, the Times Education Supplement reported the government's skills agency was cutting funding for language courses that were specifically targeted at integration into the workplace.
This government isn't the first to talk about improving community cohesion. Labour began debating this after the 2001 northern riots and the official report that warned that people were living ""parallel lives"".
So the challenge, ultimately, is whether the latest lot of ministers can do any better.",What does the government's counter-extremism strategy really amount to?,34566518
"The female dog was discovered ""dumped like rubbish"" in the Overton area of Lancaster.
Racing greyhounds are tattooed on their right ears, and it is believed the ear was cut off to destroy identification information.

"The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland.
It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said.
The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. She was found dead three days later.
In recent years, the deaths of black Americans in police custody have caused much debate and protests in the US.
Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail.
The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being ""reckless"" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm.
The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said.
A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car.
He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her ""I will light you up"".
Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody.
An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death.
""They continue to do things we are disappointed in,"" he said.
Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm.
Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias.
Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious.

PSIs cover management of prisoners at risk of harm to self, others and from others, early days in custody and medical emergency response codes.

"The oil painting was commissioned by Royal Northern Sinfonia, which wants to challenge the Austrian's ""chocolate box"" portrayal, ahead its new season.
""Somehow we've come to think of his music as pretty,"" said the orchestra's music director Lars Vogt.
""But that music is often dramatic and dark. Those qualities must have been there in the man.""
The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months.
Regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35.
Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete.
The best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni.
""Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride,"" he said. ""He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.""
Describing the existing portraits as ""cosy and pretty"", O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting.
""I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.
""Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.""
O'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono.
The portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart.
They begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33.
Musical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: ""I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.""
The German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works.
In his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of ""pop-up"" concerts in venues that echo the ""darker corners of Vienna"" that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.","A new portrait of Mozart imagines the composer as a ""daring"" and ""edgy"" musician in the mould of Johnny Rotten.",34279049
"The jack up unit Ensco 80 is expected to arrive at the field's Charlie platform in the Moray Firth over the weekend.
The rig is to be used in the plugging and abandoning of wells and a clean-up of Beatrice's platform complex.
Full decommissioning of the field's facilities could take place between 2024 and 2027.
Production at the field has ceased and it has been proposed to remove the platform complex, two demonstrator wind turbines and cables.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had an interest in using the complex as a training facility, but it has decided not to pursue this idea further.
This decision means a decommissioning programme approved by the UK government in 2004 has been updated and widened out to include the removal of the field's platforms and other structures.
Energy company Repsol Sinopec Resources UK set out details last month of the planned decommissioning and uploaded an environmental impact assessment scoping report online.
The field, about 13 miles (22km) off the Caithness coast, forms part of the site of a massive planned offshore wind farm project.
The planned decommissioning project involves the removal of five platform structures and power cables.

"SABMiller said it had agreed ""in principle"" a £44-a-share offer, after four previous attempts from AB InBev.
AB InBev's brands include Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, while SABMiller produces Peroni and Grolsch.
If the deal, worth about £70bn, goes ahead, the newly-created firm will make about 30% of the world's beer.
SABMiller has a workforce of close to 70,000 people in more than 80 countries, and global annual sales of more than $26bn. AB InBev has a workforce of 155,000 and global revenues of more than $47bn.

AB InBev had made four previous bid approaches for SABMiller - at £38, £40, £42.15, and £43.50 per share - but they had been rejected by SABMiller, which argued they undervalued the company.
In a statement, the boards of the two firms said they had now ""reached agreement in principle on the key terms of a possible recommended offer"".
The two companies have not yet formally finalised the terms of an offer, but the latest development means they have extended the City deadline for a firm offer until 28 October.
Analysis: Matthew Davies, business reporter, Johannesburg
SABMiller's African brands are actually one of the main reasons AB InBev is so thirsty for this merger. Carlos Brito, the chief executive of AB InBev, has said that Africa is a ""key piece"" of the deal.
SABMiller, of course, has its roots in Africa - South African Breweries was founded around the time of gold rush in Johannesburg in the late 19th Century. As it stands, and if this deal goes through, it would mean that the merged entity would control 31% of global beer sales.
AB InBev's brands are largely concentrated in the Americas and Europe; SABMIller has about 40 brands in Africa. It was the growth of SABMiller's African brands that really attracted AB InBev.
What makes these brands so tasty is the growing African middle class, an army of consumers that all the major brewing companies have been eyeing up in recent years. As African beer drinkers have become more prosperous over the past 20 years, they have moved out of the informal home-brewing market and started to buy branded beer.
The latest proposal comes a day before the original deadline, by which AB InBev had to make a formal bid for SABMiller or walk away for six months.
The offer represents a premium of about 50% over and above SABMiller's share price in mid-September, before the bid battle started.
In morning trade in London, SABMiller's share price rose 9% to £39.48, while shares in AB InBev were 2.85% higher at €101.15 in trading in Brussels.",The world's two biggest beer producers are set to merge after SABMiller accepted an increased takeover offer from rival Anheuser-Busch InBev.,34513520
"A floor stone dedicated to Larkin - who died in 1985 - will join the names of the country's best-loved poets including WH Auden, TS Eliot and William Wordsworth.
It will be unveiled on 2 December 2016, the 31st anniversary of Larkin's death.
The last poet to be honoured was Ted Hughes in 2011.
With poems like The Whitsun Weddings and This Be The Verse - which contains his famous musings on ""your mum and dad"" - Larkin is widely regarded as one of Britain's finest 20th Century poets.
The decision to honour him was made by the Dean of Westminster, the Very Rev Dr John Hall.
""Philip Larkin is one of the great poets of the 20th Century in English and it's been pressed on me by a number of his colleagues and friends that it's the right time to memorialise him,"" Dr Hall told the BBC.
Prof Edwin Dawes, who chairs the Philip Larkin Society, said Larkin's words were quoted more frequently than those of any of his poetic contemporaries.
""The memorialisation of Philip Larkin in Poets' Corner will be warmly welcomed by his many admirers in all walks of life,"" he said.
""We are delighted that in 2016 Larkin will take his place at the very cultural heart of the nation, in Westminster Abbey amongst Britain's greatest writers.""
Born in Coventry in 1922, Larkin studied at Oxford and had his first poems published in 1940.
He took up the position of librarian at the University of Hull in 1955 and, in the same year, published his acclaimed collection The Less Deceived.  His last collection High Windows was published in 1974.
In December 1984, a year before his death from cancer, he was offered the chance to succeed Sir John Betjeman as Poet Laureate but declined, being unwilling to accept the post's high public profile.
The posthumous publication of Larkin's letters gave an often unflattering insight into his inner life and led to accusations of racism and misogyny.
Despite the dent to his reputation, in 2003 Larkin was chosen as the nation's best-loved poet of the last 50 years, in a survey by the Poetry Book Society.

Doctors, who held the vote after discussing the plans at a meeting on Monday, said the recent decision to withdraw consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services at the hospital for 18 months has left them feeling demeaned.
Dr Richard Lewis, secretary of the Welsh British Medical Association, said that following a number of high-profile resignations at the board two years ago after a damning report on management failings, communications between the board and the wards remained poor.
""The situation in terms of the board's ability to communicate with its frontline staff are as bad if not worse than ever,"" he told BBC Wales.
""That gap seems not be closing; in fact on this particular issue it seems to be widening, which is a real worry.""

"Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani had agreed to contribute towards the cost.
The prison, covering 43 hectares (106 acres) in the north of city, has thousands of inmates, including many of Iran's political prisoners.
Human rights activists say they have documented systematic abuses there.
Last year, the head of Iran's prison service was replaced amid allegations that inmates at a special wing at Evin used to hold political prisoners, academics, intellectuals and journalists were badly beaten by guards.
Iranian dailies welcomed the Tehran municipality's plans to turn Evin prison into a park.
""Converting the prison into a museum or park has been a long-time wish of many citizens,"" said the centrist Ebtekar daily. ""It is good news as Evin is among the few regions in Tehran that has good weather and the city's residents could make good use of the park.""
But many commentators on news websites and social media were critical.
One Facebook user said that the planned park ""would reek of blood"". ""How can I walk in a park which is tied to the bitterest moments of my life,"" tweeted another.
Others wondered about the logistics of the move.
""There is concern that moving the prison out of Tehran will inflict more problems on the prisoners and their families,"" suggested an opinion piece on the moderate Asr-e Iran website.
Evin was also used to detain many activists arrested when millions participated in protests after the disputed re-election of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009.
Several are believed to have died as a result of torture, ill treatment, or medical neglect.
Judiciary officials have said they plan to move prisons and military bases outside the capital, and two months ago plans were presented to change Evin's purpose, according to the AFP news agency.
On Monday, Mr Qalibaf told reporters that he had discussed the future of Evin at a meeting with Ayatollah Larijani.
""He told me that [the judiciary] had reviewed the [Tehran] municipality's proposal and that they were ready for the municipality to start talks to turn the Evin prison complex into a green space,"" he was quoted as saying by the Tasnim news agency.

"The technique is being hailed as a breakthrough in understanding how the trillions of complex cells in a body are descended from a single egg.
""It has the potential to provide profound insights into how normal, diseased or damaged tissues are constructed and maintained,"" one UK biologist told the BBC.
The work appears in Science journal.
The human body has around 40 trillion cells, each with a highly specialised function. Yet each can trace its history back to the same starting point - a fertilised egg.
Developmental biology is the business of unravelling how the genetic code unfolds at each cycle of cell division, how the body plan develops, and how tissues become specialised. But much of what it has revealed has depended on inference rather than a complete cell-by-cell history.
""I actually started working on this problem as a graduate student in 2000,"" confessed Jay Shendure, lead researcher on the new scientific paper.
""Could we find a way to record these relationships between cells in some compact form we could later read out in adult organisms?""
The project failed then because there was no mechanism to record events in a cell's history.
That changed with recent developments in so called CRISPR gene editing, a technique that allows researchers to make much more precise alterations to the DNA in living organisms.
The molecular tape recorder developed by Prof Shendure's team at the University of Washington in Seattle, US, is a length of DNA inserted into the genome that contains a series of edit points which can be changed throughout an organism's life.
Each edit records a permanent mark on the tape that is inherited by all of a cell's descendants. By examining the number and pattern of all these marks in an adult cell, the team can work back to find its origins.
Developmental biologist James Briscoe of the Crick Institute, in London, UK, calls it ""a creative and exciting use"" of the CRISPR technique.
""It uniquely and indelibly marks cells with a 'barcode' that is inherited in the DNA. This means you can use the barcode to trace all the progeny of barcoded cells,"" he said.
Jay Shendure collaborated with molecular biologist Alex Schier of Harvard University to prove the technique on a classic lab organism - the zebrafish.
Not only did they show the technique works, they could trace the lineage of hundreds of thousands of cells in mature fish. They also showed it has the power to change perceptions about biological development.
""We can look at individual organs - say the left eye or the right eye, or the gills or the heart,"" Prof Shendure explained in an interview with the BBC's Science in Action radio programme, ""and the real surprise was that in every organ we looked at, the majority of the organ came from just a handful of progenitor cells.""
For example, although they identified over a thousand cell lineages within one of their fish, it took only five of them to create most of the blood cells. The surprise is evident in the published paper, which includes a few suggested explanations. James Briscoe also finds the discovery remarkable.
""It's striking that a barcode found in one organ was rarely found in another,"" he wrote in an e-mail, adding that in the early embryo, cells are often mobile and so a richer mix could be expected. An unexpectedly small group of ""founder cells"" would be one explanation.
Or ""there could be many founding cells, from different lineages (barcodes), at early embryonic stages, but many of these lineages die off as the tissue develops.""
Further experiments with the technique could unwrap the details. But the fact that a simple, profound question was immediately thrown up by the new technique shows just how powerful it is.
And the technique does not have to be limited to healthy development.
""Cancers develop by a lineage, too,"" Alex Schier told the BBC. ""Our technique can be used to follow these lineages during cancer formation - to tell us the relationships of cells within a tumour, and between the original tumour and secondary tumours formed by metastasis.""
And Prof Shendure points out that many inherited diseases develop because of faulty genetic programming.
""Many of these may well have their basis in the skewing of the cell lineage,"" he explained.
The technique comes with the somewhat tortured acronym GESTALT - the German for ""shape"". It is easy to use, and could easily be improved, says Jay Shendure. James Briscoe is already thinking of ways to use it with his experimental animals - mice.
For developmental biology, GESTALT could be the shape of things to come.","Researchers have invented a DNA ""tape recorder"" that can trace the family history of every cell in an organism.",36397034
"Rafa Benitez's ill-fated reign had left Los Blancos trailing both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga, with points dropped in four of their previous eight games and memories still fresh of a humiliating 4-0 home thrashing by Barca.
Now, less than nine months later, not only are Zidane's Real the European champions, they are also on the verge of breaking La Liga's all-time record for consecutive victories.
Sunday's 2-0 triumph at Espanyol was the 16th straight victory for Zidane's men, who ended last season just one point behind champions Barca after winning their final 12 games. This season they have established early control of top spot with maximum points from four games.
That winning streak is a Real record and also equals the best winning sequence in Spain's top flight, achieved by Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barca in 2010-11.
And they have the chance to beat that on Wednesday with victory over Villarreal at the Bernabeu.
So, how has Zidane done it? Not in the way you might have expected.
Saturday, 27 February 2016 was a major turning point in 44-year-old Zidane's early managerial career.
Real lost their derby at home to Atletico 1-0, jeered off by dissatisfied fans who felt the team had failed to progress since Benitez's exit.
Until then, Zidane had shoe-horned as many attacking players into his line-ups as possible in an attempt to fulfil his pledge to deliver the kind of exciting, free-flowing football associated with his playing days.
It wasn't working. The forwards were getting in each other's way and the lack of defensive instincts in midfield was making the team vulnerable, brutally exposed by the way Atletico strolled unchallenged through the centre of the pitch for Antoine Griezmann's match-winner.
Zidane knew something had to change - and that something was the introduction of defensive midfielder Casemiro, the low-profile Brazilian who had previously only played 23 minutes under his management.
Casemiro, 24, moved to the Bernabeu from Sao Paulo in February 2013, making his debut under Jose Mourinho in a 3-1 home win over Real Betis two months later.
But Carlo Ancelotti sent him on loan to Porto for the season in the summer of 2014, then he was largely left on the bench by Benitez and initially by Zidane, with both managers compromised by the pressure to field more flamboyant, attacking talents.
However, derby defeat forced Zidane to rethink, and Casemiro rapidly became indispensable, with his powerful physique, tackling ability and positional discipline giving the team a previously lacking defensive presence in midfield.
Real began their winning streak with a 3-1 triumph at Levante, and were five victories into it when the game that would prove to be their turning point arrived: the Clasico at Barcelona on 2 April.
Barca were paying tribute to club legend Johan Cruyff, who had died a week earlier, and they had every intention of marking his memory with another crushing victory over their biggest rivals.
Instead, it proved to be a prototype performance from Zidane's new-look team, who were undeterred by falling behind to Gerard Pique's header and bounced back to win with goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.
There was little flair in Real's victory, but the players obeyed Zidane's command - delivered in the wake of the defeat by Atletico - to ""run more"".
Notably, the French coach delivered the same message in the build-up to the Champions League final against their city rivals in May, urging: ""What we have to do is run, run, run and run.""
Forget spectacular, attacking football inspired by megastar Galacticos, Zidane was turning his team into a bunch of grafters committed to their defensive duties and increasingly confident in their ability to grind out wins even when not playing well.
Seven of Real's past 19 victories have been secured by goals in the last 10 minutes - most recently the Champions League triumph over Sporting Lisbon which prompted Marca to hail them as ""Comeback FC"" and state Zidane has ""recovered the virtue of never giving up"".
Although his strongest XI more or less picks itself, Zidane is committed to a policy of squad rotation, regularly emphasising the importance of a group mentality and insisting every player is important.
Every manager says similar things but Zidane's talk is not just empty rhetoric, with his commitment to rotation backed up by statistics.
He has fielded 21 players in Real's four league games this season - and only goalkeeper Kiko Casilla (deputising for Keylor Navas) and Sergio Ramos have started all four.
Furthermore, Zidane has selected five different forward lines in his team's six competitive games, and their 12 league goals have been scored by 11 different players. You can't get much more 'group mentality' than that.
Spain's most famously pro-Real journalist, Tomas Roncero from newspaper AS, this week saluted Zidane by writing: ""Zidane leads a squad of 24 players, not 11.
""This squad doesn't just have a plan B, but also a plan C and plan D. I've never seen a Madrid so complete, versatile, and reliable.""
That tribute is also, naturally, an unspoken dig at Barcelona, who are routinely accused of being too reliant upon their Messi-Suarez-Neymar forward line and, when the second-stringers started at home to Alaves 10 days ago, lost 2-1.
Not many managers could leave out a player for months, recall him to the starting line-up, see him score a record-breaking goal and then hear that player declare the manager ""will always be my idol"".
But Zidane was given that endorsement by James Rodriguez after the Colombia international, making his first start of the season, rifled home the opener in Real's hard-earned 2-0 victory at Espanyol on Sunday.
And it's clear that Zidane, a 1998 World Cup winner with France who became a Real legend with a brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final victory over Bayer Leverkusen, is benefitting from the credibility provided by his stellar playing career.
Zidane commands automatic respect - and his aura makes it easier for him to retain good relationships with players he leaves out of the team.
So, too, does his constant reassertion of the team ethic and his commitment to squad rotation - it's much easier for dropped players to stay motivated when they know they have a genuine chance of starting next week.
Considering his penchant for petulance during his playing days, it is perhaps surprising that another quality which has helped Zidane manage Real's egos is his calm and composed personality.
Whether on the sidelines, in front of the media or at the training ground, Zidane looks relaxed and always ready to smile, even maintaining his good-humoured patience when asked, as he has been countless times this summer, whether he was intending to sell James.
If you ask Barcelona fans whether Zidane is a great manager, they will scoff and say he is a lucky manager.
When asked on social media for his hopes from the Champions League, Barca star Pique ironically replied he would like the kind of campaign enjoyed by Real last season.
""Easy group. Third-placed team in Italy in the last 16 [Roma], eighth in Germany in the quarters [Wolfsburg], fourth in England in the semis [Man City]. Return leg always at home,"" Pique tweeted.
And it's true that Real - with all those late winners - have enjoyed some fortune during their record-breaking run, most recently when Sergio Ramos avoided a second yellow card for handball at Espanyol on Sunday by successfully pretending the ball hit his face.
Although the ""lucky"" argument only takes you so far, it's certainly too soon to proclaim Zidane as an unqualified coaching triumph. The season is young and it's never wise to bank on too much stability in the soap opera that is Real Madrid.
Nevertheless, a Champions League title and 16 straight league wins cannot be discounted lightly - and victory over Villarreal would be another step forward in Zidane's coaching career, which is so far threatening to be every bit as successful as his playing career.","When Zinedine Zidane was appointed Real Madrid manager in January, the Spanish giants were in disarray.",37420223

"Two-year-old Mandarin Princess, trained by Charlie McBride, was declared winner of Thursday's 13:40 race at Great Yarmouth after beating Fyre Cay.
But a scan afterwards identified the horse as three-year-old stablemate Millie's Kiss, who had been due to run in a later race at the same course.
""It's an honest error and no-one stood to gain anything by it,"" said McBride.
Stewards referred the matter to the British Horseracing Authority (BHA).
The result officially stands for betting purposes, but some bookmakers have said they will pay out on the horses finishing first and second.
McBride told the Racing Post he did not notice it was the wrong horse because he was ""stressed and rushing"" after being delayed collecting the saddle.
""I took a young girl who has been with me for two or three months to the races - she's ridden both fillies and knows them both,"" he said.
""After we checked them in we got some lunch and I sent her to get the two-year-old ready and I went to the weighing room to get the saddle.
""I like to weigh my horses out early but I had to wait over 20 minutes for the saddle.
""The filly was already out when I got back and as I was stressed and rushing I didn't look that closely - I just assumed it was the right horse.""
The BHA described the incident as ""unprecedented"" since a microchipping identification system for horses was introduced in 1999.
It said: ""The scan identified the horse to be Millie's Kiss, the trainer's other runner in race four.
""They (the stewards) interviewed the trainer, the stable groom, the veterinary officer and the equine welfare integrity officer responsible for the sampling unit.
""Having heard their evidence they referred the matter to the head office of the British Horseracing Authority and ordered Millie's Kiss to be withdrawn from race four.""
Millie's Kiss had been due to run for Newmarket trainer McBride in the 15:15 race.
The responsibility lies with the trainer to present and run the correct horse in the race.
Stipendiary steward Tony McGlone told At The Races all horses are scanned before they are brought into their stables at the course.
""We sent the horse for routine testing as normal and the veterinary officer scanned the horse and found it to be the incorrect horse,"" he said.
Punter Nicholas Quinn said the controversy had left racegoers bemused.
""This looks very bad for British racing. The one thing you shouldn't have to hope for is that the right horse is in the right race,"" he said.
John Egan, who rode the 'winner', said he was surprised the horse was not disqualified or the race declared void.
""At the end of the day, we're all human. Mistakes happen. I feel most sorry for Charlie,"" he said.
John Mear, a member of the Four Winds Racing Partnership that own Millie's Kiss, said they were ""shocked and upset"" for the trainer.
""It's nothing untoward. He's just made a genuine mistake. He must be absolutely heartbroken,"" he said.
""The issue had not been established until after the result had been made official. After the weighed in has been declared on the racecourse, the result cannot be amended by the stewards.
""The responsibility lies with the trainer to present and run the correct horse in the race.
""Having said that, and while we have not seen an incident of this nature in recent times, we will of course determine what steps need to be put in place to prevent it from happening again. We sympathise with the betting operators and betting public who have potentially been affected by this incident.""

Though this may read like something out of a Dick Francis novel, sources at the British Horseracing Authority are indicating this looks more like a cock-up than anything else.
Both horses are bay coloured fillies, and the BHA will seek to find out how they were confused by Charlie McBride and/or his staff; whatever, McBride is looking at a substantial fine.

"And I don't get to say that very often.
On the one hand, eurocrats were hurried - in wind and rain - into EU courtyards to stand in photo-op-ready groups to form the number 60.
(It's the EU's 60th birthday celebration this Saturday.)
And on the other - after months of cajoling, thinly-veiled frustration and angst from Brussels - the UK government finally made clear the date it will officially trigger the Brexit process.
Next Wednesday.
But whereas Saturday really is a huge deal for the EU - marking decades of togetherness at a time when the union is very much under threat from populist nationalism across the EU, inequality and discord in the eurozone, migration complications and Brexit itself, of course - next Wednesday, while an historic day in the UK, will not play out so big this side of the Channel.
There is a determination here that Brexit must no longer be allowed to dominate and overshadow EU politics as it has done since way before the UK referendum even.
One high-level source told me that after Brussels received Britain's formal notification of its intention to leave, Brexit would immediately be downgraded to one of many EU issues to be dealt with, rather than The Big Thing.
""There will be no major political apocalyptic show,"" he assured me.
But of course, the underlying EU fear remains that if a Brexit deal is too sweet for the UK, other countries may be inspired to also walk out the door.
Brussels officials are grateful that Theresa May did not trigger Article 50 this week, so close to the EU's birthday bash.
The tone there will be resolutely upbeat, rather than focused on one of its key members leaving the club.
As for the what-happens-next with Brexit, the rule in Brussels is: don't expect too much too fast. Ever.
The remaining 27 EU leaders, or at least their teams, began getting diaries together on Monday.
To fix a date (expected in around five or six weeks) for that all-important summit when they'll agree their red lines and guidelines for Brexit negotiations.
The European Commission will lead the UK talks from the EU side - but all the initial meetings will be about who will meet, when, in which country, discussing what and in which order.
Most probably little of substance will be achieved before the autumn.
The EU prefers to get the key elections coming up in big-hitters France and Germany out the way first.

"The committee is intending to investigate the £1bn sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.
Its chairman Daithí McKay said they had written to Michael Noonan asking him to ensure Nama appeared at the inquiry.
However, they said Mr Noonan has so far not responded.
Mr McKay said: ""Nama have a responsibility to come before the committee to answer questions and it is disappointing that Michael Noonan has so far not responded.
""Officials from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) will attend the committee inquiry tomorrow [Thursday] and I look forward to their contribution.
""The finance committee and the wider public are entitled to access the truth about the sale of the Nama assets.""
The committee postponed its first hearing of the inquiry last week, but is due to meet again on Thursday.
Mr McKay had said they wanted to ensure they did not prejudice a police investigation or any potential criminal trial.
The National Crime Agency is leading the criminal inquiry into the Nama loan sale controversy and is concerned its investigation could be undermined.
The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) is the Republic of Ireland's ""bad bank"", set up to deal with toxic loans during the Irish banking crisis.
Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than £1bn last year.
An Irish politician, Mick Wallace, has alleged that a payment of £7m was due to be made to a Northern Ireland politician in the wake of the deal.
Mr Wallace told the Irish parliament the money had been moved for that purpose to an Isle of Man bank account controlled by the Belfast solicitor Ian Coulter.
Mr Coulter is the former managing partner of Tughans solicitors in Belfast and worked on behalf of the buyers in the Nama deal.
He said he had directed that money be transferred to the Isle of Man account for ""a complex, commercially and legally-sensitive"" reason.
He said that no politician, nor any relative of any politician, was ever to receive any money.
The money moved to the Isle of Man was later retrieved, though Mr Coulter and and his former partners at Tughans remain at odds on the circumstances of that transaction.
BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme has established the Isle of Man account was intended to facilitate payments to non-lawyers or deal fixers.

"The typical home in the East increased in cost by 8.3% in the year to the end of July, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Prices in London, which saw big rises last year, rose by 5.5%, slightly lower than the average in England of 5.6%.
Overall, UK house prices increased by 5.2% in the year to the end of July.
The other area to see significant price growth was Northern Ireland, up 7.4%.
Property values in Northern Ireland are recovering from a massive fall during the financial crisis, and remain 42% below the peak of August 2007, the ONS figures show,
Prices rose by 6.7% in the South East of England, the ONS figures show, although here - as in the East and in seven other regions - the pace of price rises has slowed.
Analysts suggest that the time of double-digit price rises in London is over for now.
""There is very much a ripple effect - the action has moved out from prime central London to the outskirts and those commuter areas where there is better value to be had, although not as much if prices continue to rise as they have been,"" said Jonathan Adams, director of central London estate agency Napier Watt.
The 5.2% average price increase in the UK was down from the 5.7% rate recorded in the previous month. Prices in Scotland fell by 1.3% and were 0.7% lower in the North East of England.
Excluding London and the South East of England, UK house prices increased by 4.4%.
The average home cost £295,000 in England, £173,000 in Wales, £154,000 in Northern Ireland and £196,000 in Scotland. In England, the highest average price was paid in London (£525,000) and the lowest in the North East (£156,000).
The average price paid in the UK was £282,000, and analysts expect this to continue to rise, not least as a result of a lack of properties in the market.
Writing in the Guardian, Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst for Savills, said that the cost of buying a property, rather than the cost of owning it, is the biggest barrier to people buying their first home. That is because a large amount is needed for a deposit, while mortgage costs are well below the norm.

"In an email from Fergus Wilson to his letting agency, leaked to The Sun, he banned ""coloured"" people from renting his homes ""because of the curry smell"".
Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the remarks were ""truly disgusting"" as well as unlawful.
Mr Wilson said it was ""not a colour issue"" but an ""economic judgement"".
Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a ""massive problem"" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months.
""If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,"" he said.
""How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?""

Ms Hilsenrath said: ""There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why.

"The foster parents say ""no discussions"" took place between them and the council prior to the children's removal.
The children - who are European migrants - were removed by social workers who accused the unnamed couple of belonging to a ""racist party"".
Council leader Roger Stone said it was launching an immediate investigation.
The BBC understands that the three children are all under 10 and one is a baby.
The education secretary said the ""wrong decision"" was made ""in the wrong way for the wrong reasons"".
By Alan SoadyPolitical correspondent, BBC News
There's been an outbreak of agreement from the main parties on the principle that being a member of a political organisation such as UKIP should not prevent someone from being considered as a foster parent. Michael Gove called it ""indefensible"". Ed Miliband said it should ""not be a bar"", distancing himself from the decision made by Labour-run Rotherham Borough Council.
The investigation announced by the government and the council inquiry will seek to establish the circumstances of this particular case.
But, politically, it will be interesting to see whether it has any bearing on political campaigning in the run up to Thursday's Parliamentary by-election in Rotherham.
He added that the Department for Education, under his leadership, would ""ask the necessary questions"" to determine what happened in this case.
Officials from the department are understood to be trying to make contact with children's services counterparts at Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council.
Mr Gove told the BBC: ""It is entirely wrong for this couple to have been treated in this way. That's why I believe we need a full explanation from the local authority as to why this decision was allowed to be taken.
""If we say you cannot foster children because you're a member of a mainstream political party or because you have views on multiculturalism then that's utterly wrong.
""This decision is arbitrary, ideological and indefensible.""
The education secretary added that the government was bringing forward new laws in the Children and Families' Bill to reverse the current position, which takes into account ethnic and cultural factors when placing children for adoption.
""We want to make it clear that you should not allow ideological matters to preclude what's in the best interest of the child.""
Rotherham councillor Paul Lakin, cabinet member for children, young people and families Services has ordered an immediate investigation.
He said: ""Membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children. The council takes its safeguarding responsibilities very seriously and always puts the needs of the children at the centre of that care.""
Mr Lakin added he wanted the report on his desk by Monday morning.
Meanwhile, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said that the decision may have breached the parents' right to freedom of political opinion. It welcomed the council's decision to investigate what had happened.
The council's strategic director of children and young people's services, Joyce Thacker, earlier defended the decision, saying it was influenced by UKIP's immigration policy.
She said: ""I have legal advice I have to follow for the placement of children and I was criticised before for not making sure their cultural and ethnic needs were met.
""If the party mantra is, for example, ending the active promotion of multiculturalism I have to think about that... I have to think of their longer-term needs.
Ms Thacker added she did not think UKIP was a racist party, but said it had ""very clear"" immigration policies which she could not ignore.
SOURCE: UKIP website
The unnamed couple in their late 50s, who have been approved foster parents for seven years, were eight weeks into the placement when they were approached by social workers about their membership of the party.
The BBC's Robin Brant reports that UKIP sources say the couple have been members of the party for ""over three years"" and that Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council was ""tipped off"" about their membership.
And the couple first knew there were problems around their continued fostering on 14 November.
The wife told the BBC she believed the decision had been taken ""prior to the social worker visiting us in person to tell us that the children were being removed because we were UKIP members"".
She insisted they felt they were meeting the cultural needs of the three children.
""We were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language... we enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language.
""Having been told of the religious denomination of these children - we took steps to ensure that a school of their denomination was found.
""The children have now been placed with families who are white British, therefore how are these people going to meet the cultural needs of the children?"" she added.
UKIP's immigration policy states the party wants an ""end [to] the active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism by local and national government"", and urges Britain to leave the European Union (EU).
The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said he was ""very upset and very angry"" about the decision and called for ""heads to roll"" at the council.
He added: ""This couple... have been fostering for many years and are very decent people. This was an awful shock to them, not to mention the upset for the children themselves.""
He also accused the Labour-controlled council of bigotry towards his party.
Earlier, Labour leader Ed Miliband called for the council to urgently investigate the circumstances of the case.
He insisted: ""Being a member of UKIP should not be a bar to adopting or fostering children.
""We need to find out the facts and the council urgently needs to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.
""There are thousands of children who need to be looked after, who need fostering, we shouldn't have the situation where membership of a party like UKIP excludes you from doing that.""
Robert Tapsfield, chief executive of the Fostering Network, said the decision seemed ""very strange"" considering the council viewed the couple as providing a good standard of care.
He said the placement of foster children should not be influenced by their political affiliations.","Michael Gove has branded a decision by Rotherham council to remove three children from a foster couple because they belong to UKIP as ""indefensible"".",20476654
"Microsoft paid more than $1bn for most of AOL's patents, beating rivals reported to have included Facebook.
Facebook was sued by Yahoo for patent infringement earlier this year.
The social networking site, which is preparing for a stock market listing, also reported a drop in its first quarter profits to $205m from $233m a year earlier.
A Facebook lawyer described the deal as: ""Another significant step in our ongoing process of building an intellectual property portfolio to protect Facebook's interests.""
Microsoft bought 925 patents and patent applications from AOL. It is now selling 650 of those patents to Facebook as well as licences to the other 275.
""Today's agreement with Facebook enables us to recoup over half of our costs while achieving our goals from the AOL auction,"" said Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith.
There has been a series of recent patent deals between technology companies as they try to defend themselves in lawsuits.
If a company successfully sues another it can demand a sales ban of its competitor's products, or force the loser to pay expensive licence fees.
Since the start of the year, Intel, Google and Facebook are among those to have bought significant numbers of patents from other technology companies.
Facebook bought a number of patents from IBM last month.
Also on Monday, Facebook reported results for the first three months of the year.
The company, which is expected to list on the stock market in the coming months, reported a drop in its net income between January and March to $205m from $233m in the same period last year.
Revenues for the quarter came in at $1.06bn, down 6% from the final three months of 2011.
Facebook said that its advertising business usually slows down in the first quarter but that the growth of the business in previous years had masked that trend.

"Zhou Youguang helped invent Pinyin, a writing system that turns Chinese characters into words using letters from the Roman alphabet.
This makes it easier to learn how to pronounce Chinese words, and is credited with helping raise literacy rates in China.
Despite his achievements, Mr Zhou remains largely unknown in his home country.
Perhaps that is because the 106-year-old is a defiant character, refusing to take much credit for his work or pander to the Chinese Communist Party.
He is critical of the party that governs China - and old enough not to care who is listening to what he has to say.
""What are they going to do, come and take me away?"" he said in an interview with the BBC in his sparsely furnished Beijing home.
Positive outlook
Mr Zhou's life has coincided with most of the momentous events of China's recent history, as it has moved from imperial dynasty to peoples' republic to capitalist powerhouse.
He was born in 1906 into a wealthy family that managed to lose its money three times: first in the Qing dynasty, then during World War II and finally during the Cultural Revolution, a political campaign launched by Mao Zedong.
Nevertheless, he managed to get a good education, studying economics at St John's University, one of the best educational institutions in Shanghai in the 1920s when he was there.
Several years of his early life were spent working in the US for a Chinese bank. ""It was at No 1 Wall Street - the centre of imperialism,"" he said, laughing.
Mr Zhou laughs a lot, a result of an optimistic outlook. ""There are good aspects to even bad things,"" he said.
That does not mean everything in the centenarian's life has gone his way.
His daughter died of appendicitis just before her sixth birthday and, like many intellectuals, he was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.
A common form of punishment at the time - in the late 1960s - was to send educated city professionals to the countryside to ""learn from the masses"".
Mr Zhou spent several years working in the fields of Ningxia, a poor region in western China.
""It was a waste of time and stopped me doing other things,"" he said, unable to stop himself laughing again.
Despite hardships, Mr Zhou did have one enormous stroke of luck.
When the Communist Party took over in China in 1949, he was in the US. He decided to return, along with many others, to build a new country.
He initially become an economics professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, but in 1955 was invited to join a committee in Beijing looking at simplifying the Chinese language.
At first he resisted, saying he had no professional experience in this field. He was finally persuaded to join the project by a friend.
It was a decision that probably saved his life.
A few years later, Chairman Mao launched one of his first purges, and many of those caught in the mayhem were those who had gone back to China from abroad.
""All university professors who'd returned from the US were labelled 'Rightists'. Many committed suicide, including some good friends. I luckily missed it,"" he said.
It was one of the few moments that Mr Zhou did not laugh.
Dark future?
The work he did on the committee not only saved him, it allowed him to make a major contribution to the Chinese language.
When he started work on developing Pinyin, 85% of Chinese people could not read or write. Now, that is just a few percent.
There had been previous attempts to Romanise Chinese characters, but the system developed by Mr Zhou and his colleagues is the one that most people now use, and is recognised internationally.
""We spent three years developing pinyin. People made fun of us, joking that it had taken us a long time to deal with just 26 letters,"" he said.
Having lived so long and done such high-profile work, the linguist has met more than his fair share of historical characters.
One of his favourite stories is about Puyi, China's last emperor, who became an ordinary citizen under Chairman Mao.
Mr Zhou once belonged to a Chinese body that advises the government, work that allowed him to dine at the organisation's canteen in Beijing.
During one of the country's periodic food shortages, he ate there daily, taking his wife along too. This meant more food at home for Mr Zhou's relatives.
""Everyday when I went to eat, there was an old man sitting next to me. He was also there with his wife,"" he said.
""It was Puyi - the last emperor. Imagine, even the emperor had to eat there because he didn't have enough food.""
Mr Zhou's age has also given him a long view of history. He believes the Chinese Communist Party will not always rule the country.
""China will have to release itself from communism. The future will be dark if it doesn't,"" said Mr Zhou, who retired at 85, but is still writing books.
It is a damning comment from a man who came back to China because he believed the Communist Party when its leaders said they were democratic.
Does he ever regret that decision?
""We believed Mao's words. We didn't know that when he got into power he would become the worst kind of dictator,"" said Mr Zhou.
""But I don't regret coming back - there's no point,"" he added, laughing again.","Students struggling to learn Chinese might not know it, but their task has been made easier because of the work of one man.",17455067

"Archbishop of Westminster Vincent Nichols said Christians were the most persecuted people, but few of them would receive sanctuary in the UK.
The government has said 20,000 refugees will be brought to Britain directly from refugee camps around Syria.
But Cardinal Nichols said most Christians did not go into the camps.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today, Archbishop Nichols said: ""I can see the point in going directly to the refugee camps, but in fact I think its unintended consequence will be that there will be few, if any, Christians coming to this country.
""That is because for the most part Christian refugees do not go into the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) camps. They go to fellow Christian organisations.""
He added: ""If we are going to deal purely with UNHCR according to their rules, then there can be no preference given to anybody on behalf of their faith and we will simply bypass the Christian refugees, not intentionally but in fact.""
It comes as the Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, will say that Britain has lost its sense of proportion in relation to the refugee crisis.
In his Christmas sermon at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff he is expected to say that the ""debate seems to be centred on how many refugees we should accept. We forget to ask, or perhaps we choose to forget, why there are so many refugees in the first place"".
The refugees being brought to the UK will be drawn from established refugee camps, initially as part of the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme.
More than 50 local authorities have taken a share of those who have already arrived.

He will be in charge for the final time when they host Birmingham as the Championship season ends on Saturday.
""The club feels that it is necessary to have a change. We want to create a spark to take us to another level,"" said chief executive Ken Choo.
Slade joined Cardiff in October 2014 from Leyton Orient and has said he wants to stay with the Bluebirds.
He held talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman following the defeat at Sheffield Wednesday which ended their play-off hopes.
Slade has insisted he has made ''progress'' at Cardiff this season with the Bluebirds destined to finish either seventh or eighth, having been placed 11th at the end of the 2014-15 season.
He succeeded Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who was in charge when Cardiff were relegated from their only season in the Premier League, 2013-14.
Cardiff had targeted a place in the play-offs, and fell short as they recorded one win in their previous six matches.
Choo's comments hint that the club feel Slade has taken the team as far as he can.
""We feel it is necessary to have a vacancy in that position,"" he said.
""And then have some body take it to another level.
""This season we have improved significantly. We want to build on it so we are trying to create a leaner and meaner team for next season.""

"While its recommended nationwide pay rate goes up from £7.85 an hour to £8.25 - an increase of 40p - in London the suggested rise is only 25p.
Next year, when the government brings in a compulsory National Living Wage across the United Kingdom, there will be no separate rate for London.
The living wage is calculated according to the basic cost of living.
The capital's voluntary living wage - which is not legally enforceable - is assessed by the Living Wage Foundation and economists at the Greater London Authority.
Mayor Boris Johnson's office estimates 724 employers in London have now signed up.
Those employers now have six months to implement the new pay level.
National minimum wage: The current mandatory minimum is £6.70 per hour for people aged 21 and over, and £5.30 for those aged 18 to 20
National Living Wage: This will be mandatory from April 2016 for workers aged 25 and above. It will initially be set at £7.20 an hour and is intended to exceed £9 an hour by 2020
London living wage: A voluntary higher rate of the living wage in the capital, which will rise from £9.15 to £9.40 an hour. There are currently no plans to make this scheme mandatory
Mr Johnson said the move would help ""pay the people who work hardest on lowest incomes decently"".
While he is a prominent supporter of the voluntary London living wage, he has resisted calls to make it mandatory, saying small businesses ""would struggle with wage rigidity"".
Labour's mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan called in-work poverty ""a shameful blight on our city"", adding: ""Neither the government nor the mayor are doing enough to turn things round.""

"Sian O'Callaghan, 22, was last seen leaving Suju alone at about 0250 GMT on Saturday to walk half a mile home.
About 400 people took part in the search of Savernake Forest near Marlborough which is due to resume at 1030 GMT on Wednesday.
A £20,000 reward to help find her has been offered by an anonymous donor.
Mobile records put her phone in the area of the 4,500-acre forest 32 minutes after she left the club.
Police say the journey could only have been made by car.
Miss O'Callaghan's friends and her boyfriend Kevin Reape joined the search along with local people, many of whom did not know the missing woman, following a police appeal for help.
Volunteers searching the dense woodland were divided into groups which were then assigned to a specialist police officer.
Mikey Jack, 19, who plays Sunday league football with Mr Reape, said: ""A lot of people here don't really know Kevin or Sian but they just want to help any way they can.""
Another volunteer, college student Tizanne Gregory, 17, added: ""I came here today in the hope of finding Sian.
""I'm just hoping we can do anything to help her parents and it is horrible not knowing where she is.""
A police spokesman said Miss O'Callaghan had an LG E900 Optimus mobile phone and asked for anyone who finds one to contact the force.
CCTV footage of Miss O'Callaghan alone in the nightclub has been released in the hope that it will jog revellers' memories.
The black and white footage shows her walking downstairs and outside through the club's entrance, past a small group of men.
A police spokesman said the times shown on the CCTV were about six minutes slow.
He urged anyone who remembered seeing Miss O'Callaghan to contact the force.
Her disappearance has been described as totally out of character.
More than 60 police officers are working on the investigation which is being treated as a missing person inquiry.
Det Supt Steve Fulcher said: ""Sian left Suju and walked along the High Street in Old Town and there were a number of vehicles moving through the High Street between 2.55am to 3am.

"Gayle (75no) and Pollard added 65 off 25 balls as the Windies racked up 205-4, the highest score of the tournament.

It was a phenomenal display from West Indies, based around another exhibition by the peerless Gayle.
""The reason Gayle is so good is that normally a batsman puts the bad ball away for four, but Gayle doesn't even have to hit the ball cleanly and it goes for six. He's so powerful, the grounds aren't big enough for him.""
Despite facing only 41 balls in the 20-over innings and requiring treatment midway through for a side strain, the left-handed opener still managed to get within 25 runs of a century, smashing six sixes and five fours with a strike rate of 182.
Marlon Samuels helped set the tempo with a breezy 26 and Dwayne Bravo hit three towering sixes in his 37 off 31 balls.
However, it was Gayle and Pollard, who plundered 63 runs off the last four overs, who really demoralised Australia.
After watching the previously economical Mitchell Starc carted for 17 in the penultimate over, Bailey took a gamble by throwing the ball to left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty.
It proved a costly mistake as Gayle heaved a six over midwicket before Pollard helped himself to three maximums in a row.
He holed out at long-off off the last ball of the innings to fall for 38 off 15 deliveries, but the damage had been done.
Australia's best chance of joining their women's team in the final by completing the joint second highest successful run chase in the tournament's history was always likely to lie with prolific openers David Warner and Shane Watson.

Warner was dismissed off the last ball of the first over when a television replay confirmed that a googly had shaved his off stump.
After Mike Hussey top-edged a return catch to Marlon Samuels following a rapid 18, Watson was castled for seven by one that fizzed on.
Ravi Rampaul took two wickets in three balls - Cameron White caught down the leg side and David Hussey caught and bowled off a leading edge - before Matthew Wade was caught sweeping to leave Australia reeling on 43-6.
Bailey, not renowned for his ball-striking, led a one-man counter-attack, but with the required run-rate creeping above 14 per over, his innings was nothing more than a footnote to proceedings.
So it proved as Pollard removed Pat Cummins and Bailey in the same over, Brad Hogg was stumped off Sunil Narine and Rampaul bowled Starc to wrap up a phenomenal win.

"Many people have been reluctant to seek medical treatment for Ebola, fearing that diagnosis might mean death as there is no proven cure.
A team of 30,000 people is going house-to-house to find those infected and distribute soap.
But critics say the lockdown will damage public trust in doctors.
Meanwhile in neighbouring Guinea, the bodies of eight missing health workers and journalists involved in the Ebola campaign have been found.
A government spokesman said some of the bodies had been recovered from a septic tank in the village of Wome. The team had been attacked by villagers on Tuesday.
Guinea's prime minister said an investigation was under way, and vowed to catch the perpetrators of the ""heinous murders"".
Correspondents say many villagers are suspicious of official attempts to combat the disease and the incident illustrates the difficulties health workers face.
Sierra Leone is one of the countries worst hit by West Africa's Ebola outbreak, with more than 550 victims among the 2,600 deaths so far recorded.
In the capital, Freetown, normally bustling streets were quiet, with police guarding roadblocks.
During the curfew, 30,000 volunteers will look for people infected with Ebola, or bodies, which are especially contagious.
They will hand out bars of soap and information on preventing infection.
Officials say the teams will not enter people's homes but will call emergency services to deal with patients or bodies.
Volunteers will mark each house with a sticker after they have visited it, reports say.

Another resident in Kenema, in the east of the country, told the BBC families were struggling because the price of food had gone up.

Cities and towns across the country were quiet without the usual early morning Muslim call to prayer and the cacophony of vehicles and motorbikes that people wake up to here.
Thousands of volunteers and health workers have assembled at designated centres across Sierra Leone and started moving into homes.
But they had to wait for hours before their kit - soaps and flyers - could reach them.
MP Claude Kamanda, who represents the town of Waterloo near Freetown, told local media that all the health centres there were closed, hours after the health workers and volunteers were meant to assemble for deployment to homes.
He complained that the delays were not helping the campaign.
The UN Security Council on Thursday declared the outbreak a ""threat to international peace"" and called on states to provide more resources to combat it.
Meanwhile, the US military has started work in the Liberian capital Monrovia to establish an air bridge - a link by air transport - to take health workers and supplies to affected countries.
The UK has pledged to help build new treatment centres and provide 700 new hospital beds in Sierra Leone, although a majority of the beds could take several months to arrive.
Aid workers have welcomed the UK aid but say all of the beds are required immediately, the BBC international development correspondent Mark Doyle reports.

"The BBC's Juliana Liu followed the final campaigning hours of two young women standing for office in the city's district elections, the first polls since last October's protest movement.  Read on to find out if they succeeded.
Few souls are visible on the streets early on Sunday morning in the Hong Kong neighbourhood of Whampoa. But there are only 15 hours of campaigning left and two young, idealistic first-time candidates - part of a new breed known as the ""umbrella soldiers"" - are already in action.
Dr Kwong Po Yin, 29,  an emergency room doctor, and Yau Wai Ching, 24, a former administrator, are members of Youngspiration, a political party founded in the wake of last year's Umbrella Movement to keep its legacy alive.
Both are running against older establishment politicians with more resources, so neither presumes they will win but they will still hit the streets in their respective constituencies.
It's frustrating at times for Dr Kwong, contesting the Whampoa West district, a middle-class area with more than 8,000 registered voters. The few residents she sees are not keen to speak. Most of them seem to brush her off.
But one resident, who is walking her friendly pet parrot, stops to chat.
She is supported by a band of volunteers even younger than she is, who have been consistently campaigning. They spent the night organising election paraphernalia detailing her plans to improve transport links.
But they are not alone.  Dr Kwong's opponent, Lau Wai Wing, 64, a district councillor for more than 20 years, is already here. He says he's not surprised to face a political newcomer. He says he understands that millenials have different positions on political issues.
Spirits are somewhat higher when it comes to the hallowed Hong Kong campaign tradition of tackling the tea houses.
Dr Kwong and a volunteers greet families sitting down to a Sunday brunch of hot tea and steamer after steamer of delicious dim sum.  Buoyed by the food, drink and lively, noisy atmosphere, the residents break into ready smiles and wish Dr Kwong well.
By this time, the polling stations, almost 500 of them, have been open for seven hours.
It is already apparent, looking at the hourly data provided by election monitors, that turnout is likely to hit a record high.  The umbrella soldiers, about 50 of them, reckon the higher the turnout, the better their chances of victory.
With only three more hours of voting left, Dr Kwong is seizing the moment.
Climbing onto a ladder, bullhorn in hand, she urges passers-by to vote for her and for Ms Yau.  Their victory, she says, would show that support for the Umbrella Movement can translate into concrete political gain.
Even though district councillors do not make laws, they do help manage large sums of public money. And they have the opportunity to interact with residents daily.  These voters, Dr Kwong says, are a very powerful base of support, one that her party wants to build for many years to come.
With less than a minute to go before the polls close, election officials are looking for any stragglers.
Turnout in Whampoa West reaches a high of 50% of registered voters, significantly higher than the 41% seen four years ago. This is the kind of unfettered, credible election that democrats want for the chief executive, Hong Kong's highest official.  Their disagreement with the Chinese government on this matter is what triggered last year's protests.
Tensions soar as the election officer announces that, after three rounds of counting, there is still no clear winner.  The issue, he says, is that there are 66 ""questionable"" ballots. Each must be personally examined to see whether they are valid. The result will determine the winner.
The crowd gathers tightly around him. The stress is palpable. The official shows each ballot before making his decision.
After going through all of them, he pronounces Dr Kwong the winner of the election by just 39 votes. She looks stunned.
Meanwhile, the same process is happening across the street. Ms Yau is a credible challenge to an experienced political insider. But after rigorous rounds of counting, she appears to have lost by several hundred votes.
The turnout in that district was even higher at 55%. The two women shared exactly the same platform, but one has won and the other has lost.  After months of intense campaigning, the two political sisters hug and congratulate each other.
In her victory speech, Dr Kwong acknowledges how the Umbrella Movement transformed her from ordinary citizen to politician fighting for Hong Kong's future.",What happened when Hong Kong's  youth demonstrators actually tried to get elected?,34897403
"More than 1,000 people packed into the city's Anglican Cathedral for his funeral on Friday, with a bevy of famous Merseysiders in attendance, including comedian Ken Dodd, model Danielle Lloyd and actress Jennifer Ellison.
Howe's flamboyance, lust for life and penchant for self-promotion earned him near celebrity status in the city - what you might call a ""Scousehold name"".
But who was Howe and what was his story?
It began almost 50 years ago, when the talented snipper stated his vision of creating ""The Harrods of hairdressing"".
Born in 1944 in the Old Swan area of the city, he became a hairdressing apprentice in Bold Street before using the princely sum of Â£100 to open his first salon on West Derby Road.
Howe showed a keen talent from the outset, becoming the youngest-ever Guild master hairdresser at the age of 28.
His business grew gradually, and before long he was running Merseyside's largest hairdressing training school.
He would later be presented with a ""Scouseology"" special award for services to Liverpool.
Previous winners of the award include Paul McCartney, the late Cilla Black and Liverpool FC stalwart Kenny Dalglish.
At home mingling with the rich and famous, Howe loved showbusiness and featured on ITV docu-soap Shampoo and Channel 5's Celebrity Super Spa.
Later in life he took to the stage as a pantomime dame, for which theatre producer Jane Joseph said he was ""an absolute natural"".
""He was as much an entertainer as a hairdresser, so it was only natural that he could entertain on stage as well,"" she said.
He also chose to regularly spend his Friday night contributing to BBC Radio Merseyside's late show - an association that lasted nearly 10 years.
At his funeral, presenter Linda McDermott described Howe as ""irreplaceable"", and said he ""radiated love of people and of life, and of great kindness"".
He loved the bright and colourful - particularly pink, the colour he painted his house.
So it was no surprise that in 2006 he named his landmark Â£3m salon the Bling Bling building.
The Hanover Street salon was designed by architect Piers Gough as a place to match his vibrant and theatrical personality - and was soon frequented by the great and good on the city.
Herbert even tried his hand at politics - if only briefly.
He stood for Mayor of Liverpool in 2012, launching his campaign with a champagne reception and promising to give his mayor's salary to youth groups, but quickly withdrew because of what he described as the ""viperous attitude"" of local politics.
But friends say his greatest legacy will be his charity work.
Ms McDermott remembered how he took hundreds of young carers to Blackpool and Gulliver's World theme park and was moved to tears by a letter from a young boy thanking him.
She said Howe once brought 40 children from Chernobyl into his salon to treat them to cakes and haircuts.
He set up Queenie's Christmas Charity in 2007 in memory of his mother, who died of Parkinson's Disease.
It provides Christmas dinner at the city's famous Adelphi Hotel, for people who would be alone on Christmas day,  as well as supporting Barnardo's young carers by providing food and gifts.
Howe had said he wanted to be remembered as ""Liverpool's Father Christmas"".
Fellow hairdresser Andrew Collinge said he was ""a great man - as we know a much loved part of Liverpool - and a great hairdresser"" whose ""work for good causes was unparalleled"".
Actor Ricky Tomlinson called Howe ""a champion of the underdog"", who ""cared about people who weren't as lucky or fortunate as himself"".
Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson earlier said on Twitter he was an ambassador for the city and that there was ""less glitter"" now he has gone.","Mayoral candidate, friend to the stars, charity fundraiser, lover of pink and hairdresser extraordinaire - Liverpool has been saying goodbye to the much loved Herbert Howe.",37879710

"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were.
Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed.
His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland.
Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings.
Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in.
""It is a disappointment that is widespread.""
A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead.
Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"".
""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said.
""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases.""
Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"".
""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said.
""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits.""
A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland.

"When former US pro-basketball star and all-round character Dennis Rodman met with North Korea's sports minister this week he took along gifts for the country's authoritarian leader, Kim Jong-un.
Mr Rodman has in recent years forged an unlikely friendship with Mr Kim, a big basketball fan who is alleged to have executed hundreds of people, including close family members, to cement his authority.
The North Korean leader reportedly lives a hugely extravagant life, paid for with vast funds from the state coffers. All in all, a tricky man to shop for. Here's what Mr Rodman bought the man he called his ""friend for life"".
Gift one was President Donald Trump's 1987 ghostwritten bestseller The Art of the Deal, a guidebook on how to negotiate some of the best deals. The copy wasn't signed by the author. Or Mr Trump.
Mr Kim has at his disposal ways and means of negotiating which would be unpalatable even to a New York real estate developer. In fact, the North Korean leader, who occupies a semi-religious position in the country's political firmament, and whose every word is taken down in real time by a cadre of notebook-carrying assistants, probably has very little call to do any effective negotiating at all.
Gift number two: a copy of Where's Waldo. A seemingly bizarre gift for a world leader. Then again, could this somehow allow Mr Kim to practise for when he needs to pick a friend out of the crowd?
As for buying him the Totally Essential Travel Collection, Mr Kim has no known friendships with foreign leaders and rarely - if ever - leaves the country. Mr Rodman famously married himself in a public stunt, so we know he has a sense of humour.
Mr Kim is known to be a big fan of basketball, despite his singular dislike for the country that made the sport famous. He is said to have inherited the eccentric obsession from his father, the supreme leader, Kim Jong-il. In a failed diplomatic effort in 2000, then-US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright presented the elder Kim with a ball signed by Michael Jordan.
During a visit in 2014, Mr Rodman played - and sensibly lost - an exhibition game against a Korean side in honour of Mr Kim's birthday. He also sung him happy birthday from the court.
This is probably the most sane gift of the lot.
Both the Rodman camp and the Trump administration have said publicly that Mr Rodman is not travelling on state-sanctioned 'basketball diplomacy'.
So either they're both lying, and the mermaid puzzle, ingeniously, once completed, carries a coded message, or they're telling the truth, and one of Dennis Rodman's gifts to the leader of North Korea was a mermaid puzzle.

"The Warriors led 13-6 at the break, Zander Fagerson going over for a try with Duncan Weir and Leinster's Fergus McFadden kicking two penalties apiece.
Luke McGrath and Taqele Naiyaravoro swapped tries in the third quarter.
With winger Naiyaravoro sin-binned, Leinster edged ahead with a penalty try and McFadden landed a late penalty.
The visitors, boosted by six returning Scotland internationals and seeking a first away win over Leinster since 2011, broke the deadlock in the 13th minute, with a multi-phase attack that finished with the 19-year-old prop Fagerson muscling over from close range.
Weir's conversion was quickly followed by McFadden's first successful penalty.
A second right-sided kick from the winger closed the gap to one by the 21st minute, rewarding Aaron Dundon for a well-won ruck penalty and accurate line-out throw in the build-up.
Weir then punished Leinster for collapsing an advancing maul, punching over a fine 43-metre strike.
He repeated the trick from the opposite left wing as Mike McCarthy infringed at a maul six minutes before the interval.
Leinster missed a chance to close out the first half with a third penalty, McFadden wobbling an injury-time effort wide after Pat MacArthur saw yellow for a 'reckless' forearm-led tackle that ended Dundon's involvement in the game.
The home side made their numerical advantage count on the resumption.
Scrum-half McGrath's blindside switch led to Garry Ringrose racing up the right touchline and following a bout of forward pressure, McGrath stretched over for McFadden to convert.
Leinster were only level for six minutes, the Scots hitting back with a terrific spell of attacking and a power-packed finish to the right of the posts by big Fijian Naiyaravoro.
But the hosts took the lead for the first time through the penalty try.
Replacement Isaac Boss exploited a gap and Isa Nacewa's well-weighted kick set up a foot race between McFadden and Naiyaravoro. The latter was deemed to have deliberately slapped the ball over the end-line as the pair lunged for the ball.
After consulting with the TMO, referee Ian Davies awarded the penalty try and sin-binned the Fijian, with McFadden's conversion splitting the sides on the scoreboard.

Federal prosecutors' spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters on Wednesday that the suspect had known Amri since the end of 2015 and that the pair had met at a restaurant on the evening before the attack and had ""very intense conversations"".
The suspect's home in an asylum shelter had been searched and communication devices taken away for analysis, she added. The man is believed to have used at least two false names in several German cities between April and November 2015.
A former flatmate of Amri's is also being investigated as a potential witness. Amri twice tried to contact him on 19 December, although it is unclear whether or not they spoke.
Over a fortnight after the attack, German prosecutors have said there is now no doubt that 24-year-old Anis Amri was behind the attack.
And investigators across Europe have a clearer picture of what happened on the night of the attack and how Amri fled south to Italy. Police in Italy confirmed on Wednesday that the gun used by Amri to murder Polish driver Lukasz Urban was the same he fired four days later in Milan.
Shortly before the attack, Amri is thought to have gone to Friedrich-Krause-Ufer, a street where he shot dead Mr Urban. He then went to a mosque and returned to the lorry to carry out the attack on Breitscheidplatz a few miles away.
Amri was then seen on camera a short distance from the square at Zoo station, raising an index finger, a gesture linked to jihadist group Islamic State. What happens next is unclear, but it is thought that he escaped to the North Rhine-Westphalia area of western Germany.
His final journey took him through the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy, exploiting the open borders of Europe's Schengen zone.
Some of Amri's story is yet to emerge.

"Durham fast bowler Wood is working on his fitness after three ankle operations in the past 12 months.
Durham's Keaton Jennings will captain the North, while Hampshire's James Vince will skipper the South.
England selector James Whitaker says the series is ""a platform for players to make an impression"".
""We see it as an important addition to our selection process in 50-over cricket, ahead of the two major global events we are staging over the next three summers - the Champions Trophy next year, and the World Cup in 2019,"" Whitaker said.
Wood impressed for England during the ODI series with Pakistan at the end of the summer, but Finn has not featured for his country in limited-overs cricket since September 2015.
Jennings was a late call-up to the England Test squad in India this winter, while Vince played in the ODI series in Bangladesh in October.
Ben Duckett, who made his senior England debut in both Test and ODI cricket against Bangladesh this winter, Liam Dawson, Tim Bresnan and Harry Gurney are the other England players named in the two 13-man squads.
Four members of each squad won their places through the Professional Cricketers' Association's Most Valuable Player ranking system, with the remaining squad members picked by selectors.
England assistant coach Paul Farbrace will coach the South, while England bowling coach Ottis Gibson is in charge of the North.

"The original drawings, showing bears, panthers, rhinos and other creatures, are roughly 32,000 years old.
President Francois Hollande toured the site on Friday - a copy of the closely-guarded Grotte Chauvet in the Ardeche region of southern France.
The original is closed to the public. The copy, at nearby Vallon-Pont d'Arc, is expected to attract many tourists.
The Chauvet drawings are believed to be the oldest cave art in the world. The limestone cave, with hundreds of vivid charcoal images, was discovered by potholers in 1994 and is now a Unesco World Heritage site.
The cave was closed off by a rock fall about 20,000 years ago, which meant the art was undisturbed by humans.
Unesco says the drawings are remarkable for the skilful use of shading, combinations of paint and engraving, anatomical precision and dynamism.
Specialists spent four years reproducing the cave with the help of hi-tech tools such as 3D imaging, AFP news agency reports. The painstaking project cost â‚¬55m (Â£40m; $58m).

"The Academies Enterprise Trust (AET), which runs Weston Academy, said it made the ""sad decision"", due to falling pupil numbers.
The 56-pupil school was classed as ""inadequate"" by Ofsted in March.
A petition set up by parent George Metcalf, describing closing the school as a ""huge waste of resources"" attracted more than 500 signatures.
The campaign won the backing of the National Secular Society as parents claimed the nearest alternatives were all faith schools.
The school was placed in special measures following an Ofsted report in March which criticised leadership and management, pupils' behaviour, the quality of teaching and achievement of pupils.
But in May the watchdog reported that teaching and leadership was improving.
AET said the school had less than 40 pupils and the Department for Education had confirmed its agreement to closing the school at the end of December.
Chief executive Ian Comfort said: ""Closing a small school is always a very sad decision to make, and is only taken as a very last resort.

"Guido Tognoni worked ""extremely closely"" with the Fifa president during Blatter's second term.
""In Fifa, for many years, you could only reach your goal by taking dollars in your hands,"" Tognoni told BBC Sport.
Fifa said investigations into such claims were ongoing and, as yet, there was no evidence of wrongdoing.
The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation.
Asked if countries had any choice other than to bribe Fifa during the bidding process, Tognoni replied: ""This speculation is permitted, yes.""
Russia and Qatar deny wrongdoing, while Blatter has not been named in a separate US criminal investigation into widespread corruption at Fifa.
Domenico Scala, head of Fifa's audit and compliance committee, said if evidence emerges from either the US or Swiss investigations which shows the result was affected by bought votes, the ""awards could be cancelled"".
However, Tognoni, who was Blatter's right-hand man for a period in the mid-90s and again between 2001-2003, said he did not think the World Cups would be taken away from Russia or Qatar.
""Even if there is evidence that Fifa people were bribed, where is the problem? With Fifa, or the people who had no choice but to get the World Cup with bribing?""
In response, Fifa said in a statement on Monday: ""Fifa initiated the investigation by the Swiss authorities precisely to answer questions such as this.
""However, while investigations are ongoing, it should be noted that to date, no evidence has come to light to suggest there are any legal grounds for rescinding the current Fifa World Cup selections.""
Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested last month in high-profile dawn raids at a Zurich hotel, where they had been staying before the presidential election.
They are among 14 people charged by US prosecutors, who allege that bribes and kickbacks of more than $150m (£100m) were accepted over a 24-year period.
Blatter, Fifa president since 1998, was re-elected at the Zurich meeting but announced four days later that he would resign amid the corruption allegations engulfing the organisation.
American lawyer Michael Garcia was previously hired by Fifa to investigate the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes, but he complained that the published summary of his 430-page report was an ""erroneous"" representation of his work.
The report cleared World Cup hosts Russia and Qatar of wrongdoing.
Garcia quit weeks later over Fifa's handling of his inquiry and his comments reopened the debate about the validity of the bidding process.
Scala has since had Garcia's report reviewed by legal experts, from both in and outside of sport, but neither were able to find grounds to alter the award of either tournament at this stage.","Russia and Qatar may have had to pay bribes to secure their World Cups, Sepp Blatter's former special advisor has suggested.",33044932
"Striker Aluko, 30, quit the team in May 2016 after making the claims.
The Chelsea player said she also felt ""undermined and belittled"" by England staff and claims their negative bias contributed to her not being picked.
But the FA said an independent report found no evidence of wrongdoing by Sampson or his staff.
Aluko and the FA agreed a settlement earlier this year, with one national newspaper claiming it included a £40,000 confidentiality agreement. BBC Sport understands the figure was higher.
The FA said Aluko was not ""precluded from speaking about the facts of that complaint"" and that it agreed ""a mutual resolution"" to avoid disrupting the England squad's preparations for Euro 2017, which finished on Sunday.
England were knocked out of the competition in the semi-finals by eventual winners the Netherlands.
The case sheds light on the confusion surrounding Aluko's England career, which has stalled over the past year despite her being the Women's Super League One top scorer in 2016.
Aluko, part of the England team that won the bronze medal at the 2015 World Cup, has 102 caps and has scored 33 international goals, but last played for her country in April 2016. She remains a centrally contracted player.
A qualified lawyer, Aluko became the first female pundit to appear on Match of the Day and worked for Channel 4 in the same role during Euro 2017.
Allegations made by her include accusations of staff calling her ""lazy"", Sampson belittling her in front of the squad and what she says are ""false claims"" by Sampson of ""bad behaviour"".
In the complaint, Aluko said: ""It is inevitable that such damaging behaviour and bias from the ultimate leader of the group in the presence of my England team-mates will and has influenced other staff and team-mates to be empowered to also attempt to undermine and belittle.
""I submit that this is the basis of a culture of bullying and harassment.""
She added: ""Although I am well adjusted to the final decision of a manager, I submit that Mark Sampson's negative personal behaviour towards me has led to inconsistency, disparity of treatment and confusion regarding the criteria for team advancement.""
The FA commissioned an independent investigation conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton, which started in December and concluded in March this year.
Newton also wrote to Aluko to ""ensure complete transparency and objectivity of the findings"", the FA said.

"It's part of attempts to streamline operations at the new Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link, which will open next year, costing just under $11bn (Â£8.45bn).
Under the new plan, passengers will be able to undertake border clearance procedures for both Hong Kong and China successively in one building in West Kowloon, Hong Kong.
And it will be mainland law which will be in force in parts of the terminal, even though it's on Hong Kong soil.
The government says that will be more convenient for passengers, but opponents say it could violate Hong Kong law.
For those travelling overland, the process is similar to most border crossings between countries.
At the busiest land crossings, passengers must first clear immigration and customs in one physical jurisdiction, then walk or be driven a fair distance to clear immigration in the other jurisdiction.
Hong Kong immigration procedures are handled on undisputed Hong Kong territory, and Chinese immigration procedures are handled in Shenzhen, which is the mainland.
Hong Kong officials are touting this as a ""one-stop"" clearance.
Passengers will be able to complete both Hong Kong and Chinese clearance procedures under one roof inside the West Kowloon terminus building, before boarding trains to all cities on the national high-speed railway network.
Hong Kong officials say this will be like similar arrangements between for example the US and Canada, and the UK and France on the Eurostar.
China will lease the so-called ""Mainland Port Area"" from Hong Kong. The area will comprise the Chinese section of immigration and customs and the waiting hall for departure passengers, as well as all platforms and trains.
Full Chinese law, both criminal and civil, will prevail in this entire area, even though it is physically located on Hong Kong soil.
Hong Kong officials say the area will be considered to be outside the territorial boundary of Hong Kong.
There will be immigration, customs, quarantine, administration and police officers stationed in the area.
Hong Kong has a separate legal system from mainland China, under the One Country Two Systems framework.
Under this Basic Law, Hong Kongers have a far greater degree of freedom to protest than mainland citizens have, among other differences.
Mainland officials also have no jurisdiction in the territory.
Critics say the proposal could lead to Hong Kongers being arrested on Hong Kong soil for actions which are legal here, but not in mainland China.
It also feeds in to growing concern in recent years about Chinese encroachment into Hong Kong affairs, after the disappearance from Hong Kong of several people who sold books critical of the Chinese government, and the removal of several MPs who had protested against Beijing while being sworn in.
It is currently unclear whether Western social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are blocked in mainland China, will be accessible within the port area.

"Insp Ken Mackaill and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton are accused of gross misconduct over accounts they gave of a meeting with Mr Mitchell, and could be sacked if the disciplinary charges are proved.
The meeting followed claims the Tory MP called police ""plebs"", which he denied.
Another officer, Sgt Chris Jones, has been cleared of misconduct.
Det Sgt Hinton is from Warwickshire Police, Insp Mackaill works for West Mercia Police and Sgt Jones for West Midlands police.
All three officers, who are Police Federation representatives in the Midlands, met the Conservative MP at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012 to find out what he had said during a row in Downing Street.
It followed reports he had sworn at officers and called them ""plebs"" for refusing to let him cycle though the street's main gate.
After the meeting the men said Mr Mitchell had not given a full account and called for him to resign.
But a recording of the meeting cast doubt on what they had said.
The three officers then faced further criticism over evidence they gave to MPs before the home affairs select committee in October 2013.
Carl Gumsley, commissioner for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), directed Warwickshire Police on Monday to hold a misconduct hearing for Det Sgt Hinton.
This was after the force declined to follow Mr Gumsley's earlier recommendation that there was a case to answer.
West Mercia Police had decided, in line with Mr Gumsley's opinion, that Insp Mackaill has a case to answer for gross misconduct, and he should therefore face a misconduct hearing.
In 2014, a High Court judge rejected a libel case brought by Mr Mitchell against the Sun newspaper, concluding that ""on the balance of probabilities"" he had called a police officer a ""pleb"".
Mr Mitchell has accepted he used bad language but said he had not used that particular word.
He paid Â£300,000 in legal costs after losing the case.
Last year, the High Court described a misconduct investigation into the actions of the trio as ""lamentable"" saying there was a ""series of errors and irregularities"".

The paper has received business emails appearing to indicate that information was circulating about the scheme's imminent end.
It's been claimed that a spike in RHI applications in the two months before the scheme's October 2015 closure was due to details of its ending being widely known.
However, the News Letter points out that the department have not confirmed or commented on the latest revelation, and adds that there is no suggestion that the civil servants named acted improperly.
Sam McBride also sets out, across eight lengthy bullet points, the newspaper's justification for publishing the names of the civil servants and stresses that it is ""not alleging corruption"". Watch this space.
Elsewhere on Planet RHI, the Irish News reports that a charity watchdog is investigating after a green energy group said it would be ""ethically improper"" to warn Stormont about flaws in the scheme.
The managing director of Action Renewables, a group paid to process RHI applications, made the comments to the Irish News last week. Now the Charities Commissions says it has ""opened a concern"" on Action Renewables.
Meanwhile, the Irish News' front page is dedicated to the naming of a soldier who shot dead a man in Belfast 45 years ago, a move welcomed by the man's widow.

"The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea did, however, allow Ghana to continue developing current oilfields.
These include the so called-Ten fields, part owned by UK firm Tullow Oil.
Ivory Coast had asked that all drilling be suspended, but the tribunal ruled this would risk ""considerable financial loss"" to Ghana.
Instead, it told the West African nation to ""take all necessary steps to ensure than no new drilling either by Ghana or under its control takes place in the disputed area"" and to ""refrain from granting any new permit for oil exploration and exploitation in the disputed area"".
The area is believed to contain large reserves of oil, which both countries are keen to exploit.
Pending a ruling on the precise maritime border, the tribunal told both countries to ""pursue co-operation and refrain from any unilateral action that might lead to aggravating the dispute"".

"The 21-time Grand Slam champion was questioned on the issue after her 48-minute 6-2 6-0 Wimbledon semi-final victory against Elena Vesnina.
Roger Federer and Andy Murray's Centre Court quarter-finals against Marin Cilic and Jo Wilfried-Tsonga lasted a combined seven hours and 11 minutes.
""I don't deserve to be paid less because of my sex,"" said Williams, 34.
The American was asked about equal pay by the media after she swept into her ninth Wimbledon title in under an hour while, on Wednesday, second seed Murray and third seed Federer were both taken to five sets.
In March, male world number one Novak Djokovic said men deserved to be paid more because more people watched them.
However, the 11-time Grand Slam winner apologised shortly afterwards, saying: ""I don't make any differences between the genders. I am for equality in the sport.""
His comments followed Indian Wells tournament chief Raymond Moore saying the women's game was ""riding on the coat tails"" of the men's.
Moore, who also said female players ""should get down on their knees"" in thanks to male counterparts, later resigned.
""Basically my whole life I've been doing this. I haven't had a life,"" defending Wimbledon champion Williams said.
""I would like to see people - the public, the press, other athletes in general - just realise and respect women for who they are and what we are and what we do.""

Like Cook before him, Root has been promoted from vice-captain, an elevation such a formality that the anointing of another leader would have come as a seismic shock.
But an expected coronation does not guarantee that the crown will sit right, especially when Root is such an inexperienced skipper.
Why is he the man for the job? What type of leader might he be? And how will it affect his batting?
Root has long been tipped for the top job. As a 13-year-old playing club cricket for Sheffield Collegiate he was nicknamed 'FEC', for 'future England captain', a title once bestowed on Michael Atherton with similar accuracy.
Since he made his debut at the age of 21 in December 2012, no batsman on the planet has made more than Root's 4,594 Test runs and only India's Virat Kohli has a better tally in all international cricket. He is perhaps the most complete three-format player that England have ever produced.
The English way is to push the batting totem towards leadership - it was the same with Atherton, Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Cook, with varying degrees of success.
Now it is Root's turn. Although his leadership experience amounts to only four first-class matches, the tiny glimpses offered when he has briefly deputised for Cook hint towards an enthusiasm and dynamism for the job.
At 26, he is a year older than Atherton when he took charge, but a year younger than Cook was. With 53 Tests to his name, he has 22 more than Vaughan when he was named skipper in 2003.
""He's the obvious candidate,"" said England pace bowler James Anderson. ""The decision is a big one because he's our best player, so you obviously don't want that to be affected.
""He is fairly quiet but he has got that fire in his belly. He's a really impressive young man.
""Root gets into situations, one-on-ones, with people. He speaks a lot of sense when he does speak and he's a really impressive young man.""
Root hasn't quite been named captain by default, but it's not far off. Ben Stokes, Stuart Broad and Jos Buttler were all consulted after Cook's resignation, but it always seemed incredibly unlikely that any would beat Root to the job.
Still, there is the suggestion that Root's carefree, jovial approach might not be best suited to leadership.
""Root is the outstanding candidate, but you wouldn't want it to be a case of making your best player captain, only for it to backfire on you later,"" said former England off-spinner Graeme Swann.
""I'm still not convinced Root is the right man for the job. I want him to concentrate on being the best player we have ever had, rather than having his talent curbed by the pressures of captaincy.
""He has tried to be more sensible later, but part of his cheeky chappy persona makes him the player he is, and I don't want to see that taken away.""
And although Cook proclaimed Root to be ""ready"" for the captaincy during the tour of India, it was Root himself who said that he needs to ""start growing up a bit"" after an angry reaction to a dismissal in the fifth Test in Chennai.
Fatherhood should help, a first-born son having arrived on 7 January, but if it is a different Root who leads England out against South Africa at Lord's on 6 July, will he have the same success that brought him to the captaincy?
""It's hard to say how ready I am,"" said Root in January.
""I've got quite a lot experience in Test cricket now, but it's one of these things where you have to learn on the job.
""Being a dad you don't know what to do, you just have to go with it and see how it goes. I imagine being captain would be very similar.""
It is a downside of central contracts that England players have little or no opportunity to learn captaincy in the county game.
Arguably, another related negative is that a player can only ever be schooled by the limited number of captains he has played under.
Root, for example, has never played a Test under anyone other than Cook, while Cook's style of leadership was heavily influenced by predecessor Andrew Strauss.
With just those four first-class matches under his belt, Root is one of the most inexperienced captains ever appointed by England - at least Cook had benefited from 18 months in charge of the one-day side.
Root's style of leadership is therefore something of a mystery. The perception is that he will be more adventurous than Cook - but so is popping to the corner shop in your slippers instead of your shoes.
""Joe will know what he would like to improve or what he would like to do differently,"" said former England captain Vaughan. ""When all the speculation over Cook's future began, he will have gone home at night and thought 'what if I do get the job?'
""But you're never too sure how you're going to be as a person until you get it. You can think you're going to be X or Y, but you can't be 100% sure.""
Of the four times Root has led in the first-class game, one match was in charge of England Lions, with the other three as Yorkshire skipper.
In each of Root's matches as Tykes captain, fast bowler Ryan Sidebottom was part of the Yorkshire team.
""I get changed next to him and he can be a scruffy little git, but when it comes to cricket knowledge he's very clued up and knows everything about the game,"" said Sidebottom.
""If you look at the way he bats, he's got all the shots. He works hard on innovation, so I think he will be a creative captain.
""When he plays, he takes the game to the opposition. The English way can be quite conservative; I'm sure he'll change that for the better.""

It is incredibly English to fret over how taking on the responsibility of captaincy might affect the new leader's batting (they are almost always batsmen, after all).
However, of the seven men with the most Tests as England captain, only one - Vaughan - has an average significantly worse as captain than when in the ranks.
The batting records of Cook, Strauss and Nasser Hussain are similar whether captain or not, while Atherton, Peter May and Graham Gooch saw their runs increase with responsibility, the latter two dramatically so.
It is not just English leaders with lengthy tenures who have seen a spike in their scoring.
Of Root, India's Kohli, Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Kane Williamson - widely regarded as the four finest batsmen on the planet right now - the Englishman is the last of the quartet to take over as his nation's Test captain.
Each has seen an improvement in his batting average, Williamson by a small amount, Kohli and Smith by more than 20 runs each.
Realistically, though, England would probably settle for Root's record to hold steady.
His batting average of 52.80 is the highest by any England player to have played at least 20 innings since 1968. Any improvement on that would be pretty remarkable.
The status quo of Cook leading the Test side and Eoin Morgan taking charge of the one-day and Twenty20 outfits worked well for England because neither was a threat to the other. Both were miles away from getting into the teams they did not lead.
Three-format man Root's elevation to lead the Test side poses a problem for the England and Wales Cricket Board.
Do they leave Morgan, who has presided over an incredible improvement in England's one-day cricket and guided them to the World Twenty20 final, in charge, or give Root three sets of reins?
Those in favour of change will say there are very few examples of a Test captain playing for too long under a different limited-overs skipper, while any dip in results or form could increase pressure on Morgan.
However, director of cricket Strauss' crusade to bring limited-overs success to the England side has seen greater and greater separation between the red-ball and the white-ball teams. One skipper for all could be seen as a return to a uniform approach that had largely been abandoned.
And the relentless scheduling of international cricket more than justifies two skippers, particularly if resting Root from the shorter formats helps him cope with the mental and physical demands of Test leadership.
Consider the winter schedule of 2017-18. The five Ashes Tests that begin at the end of November are followed by an ODI series against Australia, which rolls into a T20 tri-series also involving New Zealand. After that, England play five more ODIs and two Tests against the Kiwis, which might not conclude until the end of March.
A player involved in all parts of that tour could be on the other side of the world for five months or more. Even two captains might not be enough.
England captains have a natural shelf-life.
Of the seven skippers with the most Tests, discounting any time as a stand-in, only May's reign spanned more than five years - and that ended in 1961.
Of the longest-serving skippers since the late 1980s, Gooch managed five years, Atherton four, Hussain four, Vaughan five (with an enforced 18-month break because of a knee injury), Strauss four and Cook just over four.
From the seven longest serving of all-time, Cook has taken charge of most matches thanks to the Test-hungry nature of the ECB's scheduling department.
That Root's tenure begins with five Test-free months is an anomaly, but one that will soon be compensated for. Over the succeeding 14 months or so, England will cram in 21 Tests.
If we take July to be the proper start to Root's reign and assume that the fickle mistresses of form, fitness and results allow him to be in charge for four and a half years, then his spell as skipper could end with the 2021-22 Ashes in Australia.
By then, he could have been at the helm for more than 60 Tests - an England record - and, at his current rate of scoring, will have become the second Englishman to reach 10,000 runs.
He will have just turned 31, so will still feasibly have half a decade of Test batting left in him, much like Cook does now.
At the point, a 25-year-old Haseeb Hameed could be the next unsurprising candidate to be given the keys to the kingdom.","In the least surprising move since England last needed a new Test captain, England have appointed Joe Root as the successor to Alastair Cook.",38557962

In Paris, Russian President Vladimir Putin met Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko, France's Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the first time since they agreed a peace deal for Ukraine in Minsk in February.
The so-called Normandy Four meeting assessed all elements of the deal, including the staging of local elections in the rebel-held regions and the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the line of contact.
After the meeting, Mr Hollande said the pullout would start on Saturday, with Mr Poroshenko later confirming this in a statement (in Ukrainian).
Mr Poroshenko said this process would then continue in stages and should be completed within 41 days.
He said the 100m calibre pullout would include not just artillery pieces ""but also tanks and mortars"".
Regarding the elections in the rebel-held areas, the French leader said they must be held according to Ukrainian law, as envisaged in the Minsk peace deal.
Mr Poroshenko said the four leaders had supported the idea of the elections based exclusively on Ukrainian legislation and in the presence of OSCE observers, who should be granted full access.
However, the rebels said before the Paris talks that they still intended to proceed with staging local elections on their terms.

"The girl's account was given to police and the video recording of the interview was shown at the player's trial at Bradford Crown Court.
Mr Johnson, 28, who has 12 England caps, is accused of two counts of sexual activity with a child.
The former Sunderland and Middlesbrough footballer denies the charges.
The girl, who was aged 15 at the time of the alleged incident, described how the winger was her favourite player.
""I got a message from Sunderland player Adam Johnson who I'd idolised for quite a while,"" she said.
The girl said that after exchanging messages, she first met up with him on 17 January 2015 when he signed two Sunderland shirts for her.
She said the player continued to message her, requesting a ""thank you kiss"".
""I was well up for it. It was a surreal type of thing,"" she told the police officer.
""I met up with him again. I gave him his thank you kiss and more,"" she said.
Mr Johnson sat in the dock watching the recording of the girl give her account on two large video screens.
The court heard her describe how Mr Johnson exchanged WhatsApp messages with her after their first meeting, saying ""you owe me for this"".
At the second meeting, in the player's Range Rover, she claimed he said to her: ""I've come for my thank you kiss.""
The girl said: ""I was kissing him for quite a while.
""He undid the button on my trousers. It took him a while to do that.""
The girl then described sexual activity between the pair.
Later in the interview, the police officer asked the girl what the player knew about her.
She replied he knew her age, her school year and where she sat at Sunderland home matches. ""He asked me when I was 16,"" she said.
Asked how she felt, the girl said: ""As much as I expected it to happen, I was a bit shocked it had. I sort of knew I had done something wrong.
""It wasn't that I didn't want it or anything. I just knew it was wrong.""
The jury of eight women and four men was played a second police interview during which the girl described more serious alleged sexual contact.
She said a sex act happened for three or four seconds during the pair's second meeting in his car, on 30 January last year.
The woman police officer asked her how she felt. She said: ""Not very good. I was disappointed in myself.""
When the officer asked her why she did not mention the more serious sexual contact in the first interview, she said that there was evidence on text messages to back up everything else she said, but not this sex act.
The girl broke down in tears and asked for a break when she was questioned over a video link by Mr Johnson's barrister Orlando Pownall QC about why she had asked friends to lie about what happened.
After a short break granted by Judge Jonathan Rose, she said: ""I wanted to keep him (Johnson) out of trouble. I didn't want to get him in more trouble than he was.
""I was scared that people wouldn't believe me. I didn't want to believe that it had happened.
""I tried to forget about it. I was trying to live normally.
""At the time I didn't realise it was wrong. I didn't realise what had gone on was wrong.""
Born in Sunderland, Mr Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland for Â£10m in 2012.

And his side looked bereft of drive in the first half where Watford broke quickly and had the finishing touch required in the form of the impressive Ighalo.
Newcastle repeatedly attacked down the wings, but with only four of 40 crosses finding their target, and Papiss Cisse being withdrawn at half-time after missing one decent chance, there was a lack of cutting edge.
Florian Thauvin was the most lively of Newcastle's attackers but it took Janmaat's intervention to get them back into the game, the full-back finishing well after a one-two with Moussa Sissoko.
Boos rang out from some home supporters at the end of the game, and with Chelsea and Manchester City up next, McClaren's task is not about to get any easier.
Ighalo provided the composure in front of goal that Newcastle were lacking as he extended a fabulous scoring run that has made him the most prolific striker in England's top four divisions this year.
However, he was indebted to Watford skipper Troy Deeney, who was tireless in his support play and set up the second goal with a clever ball in behind the Newcastle defence.
Three of Ighalo's four Premier League goals this season have been assisted by his strike partner.
Deeney was not alone in putting in an impressive shift for the visitors.
Once Watford had established their lead they defended superbly as Newcastle threatened from the flanks.
A solid display by the Hornets' back four was aided by convincing performances from defensive midfielders Etienne Capoue and Ben Watson, who made his first Premier League start of the season.
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores was beaming at full-time, and with good cause after a performance in which his players always seemed to offer support to team-mates, whether in attack or defence.
Newcastle boss Steve McClaren: ""I am trying to change a lot and being here two-and-a-half months, it is very difficult to change things around quickly. I think Newcastle have won three games in the last 25, after a good run in November last year, so there is history there that needs changing and turning around.""

"The authorities say they want to check whether the organisations are operating legally - particularly whether they comply with a controversial law requiring all NGOs receiving overseas funding to register as ""foreign agents"".
But human rights watchdog Agora says at least 90 NGOs have used its hotline since last week to complain about visits by officials from the prosecutor-general's office, the justice ministry and the tax authorities.
Foreign NGOs - such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Transparency International - have been among those targeted.
Marina Gridneva, from the prosecutor-general's office, said the checks were being conducted ""in strict compliance with the current legislation"".
Russian officials typically arrive unannounced, or at short notice, and request groups to hand over legal and financial documents, eyewitnesses say.
Yelena Panfilova, who heads Transparency International's office in Moscow, said she was surprised that it was being checked again - just a month after a similar inspection.
Law enforcement agents visited her office on Wednesday and gave her 24 hours to hand over paperwork. Ms Panfilova's links the checks with the new NGO legislation.
""We are on the list of NGOs that are visible and presumably receive foreign funding. As far as I understand, there is a big search for 'foreign agents' among the NGOs,"" she told the BBC.
When the controversial law on NGOs was approved in November, a number of prominent Russian groups said they would not comply - even if that risked closure.
They regard the term ""foreign agents"" as insulting, saying it harks back to Stalin-era purges.
Memorial, an NGO gathering information about victims of Communism, reiterated this position earlier this week when law enforcement agents turned up at its office.
""Memorialâ€¦ has carried out a research of people who 70 years ago were called agents by the authorities and then shot. For us, taking on the label of a foreign agent is unacceptable"", Memorial's Alexander Cherkasov told Reuters news agency.
The ""foreign agent"" bill was one of several controversial laws adopted in the aftermath of last year's pro-democracy protests in Moscow.
Other measures introduced tougher internet restrictions, outlawed ""gay propaganda"" and banned adoptions of Russian orphans by US parents.

"The Republican Party is too badly divided. His rhetoric is too incendiary. Republican voters may be ""idiots"", but the general public is wiser. The US electoral map, which places a premium on winning key high-population ""swing"" states, is tilted against the Republican Party.
About that last point. On Tuesday a survey of three key swing states - Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania - revealed a virtual dead heat between the two likely standard-bearers.
Those states - which account for 67 electoral votes - all went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Add them to the states Republican Mitt Romney carried in 2012, and it delivers 273 electoral votes - three more than the 270 necessary to win the presidency.
Throw in a national tracking poll released on Wednesday that has Donald Trump surging to within striking distance of Hillary Clinton, and it's a recipe for acute hyperventilation on the part of Democrats.
Butâ€¦ butâ€¦ butâ€¦ cooler-heads respond.
The Reuters/Ipsos national poll, which has Mrs Clinton ahead 41% to Mr Trump's 40% and 19% undecided, was conducted online.
That Quinnipiac swing-state poll oversampled white voters - a demographic group that is more inclined to Republicans. In addition, it doesn't represent that big a shift from the group's battleground-state poll from last autumn, which undermines the theory that Mr Trump's support is growing.
The news caused election guru Nate Silver to go on a Twitter tirade, asserting that it's way too early to start gaming out the state-by-state electoral map based on opinion polls.
""The election will go through a lot of twists and turns, and polls are noisy,"" he writes. ""Don't sweat individual polls or short-term fluctuations.""
Sweating polls is what US pundits and commentators do, however. And at the very least, signs that Mr Trump is within reach of Mrs Clinton should cast doubts on the early predictions that the Democrats will win in the autumn by historic, Goldwater-esque margins. Mr Trump has a pathway to the presidency.
He may not get there. It is not the most likely outcome. But it's real.
That linchpin of a Trump victory centres on the so-called Rust Belt - states like the aforementioned Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as Michigan and Wisconsin. Even if Florida, due to its rapidly growing Hispanic population, goes to Mrs Clinton, Mr Trump could still win if he sweeps those states.
It's a strategy that Mr Trump already appears to understand.
""We'll win places that a lot of people say you're not going to win, that as a Republican you can't win,"" Mr Trump said at an April rally in Indiana. ""Michigan is a great example; nobody else will go to Michigan. We're going to be encamped in Michigan because I think I can win it.""
The challenge for Mr Trump is that the mid-west, particularly, Wisconsin and Michigan, have served as a Democratic firewall that Republicans have been unable to penetrate since 1988.
""These states constantly intrigue Republican presidential strategists because the Democratic advantage in them depends largely on an act of political levitation: the ability to consistently win a slightly greater share of working-class white voters here than almost anywhere else,"" writes the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein.
If Mr Trump is to find success, then, he likely will have to finally win over this stubborn portion of the mid-western electorate or, perhaps, energise what Sean Trende of RealClear Politics has called the ""missing white voters"".
Trende points to a national drop-off more than 3.5 million white voters from the elections of 2008 to 2012, when population growth should have resulted in an increase of 1.5 million.
These voters, he theorised, were largely working-class whites who had previously supported iconoclasts like Ross Perot, the 1992 anti-free-trade independent candidate.
It's the type of voter that Mr Trump, with his populist economic pitch, has been turning out in the Republican primaries.
In 2012 Mr Obama beat Mr Romney by roughly 5 million votes. If Mr Trump can bring those disaffected white voters back to the polls in 2016, it would cut into that margin. If Mrs Clinton is unable to produce the record-setting turnout among young and minority voters that Mr Obama achieved, the gap shrinks further still.
That's a lot of ""if's"", of course. Young and minority voters - particularly Hispanics - may yet turn out to the polls in high numbers, if only to cast ballots against Mr Trump. There are already indications of record-setting Hispanic voter registration in places like California.
There's also the risk that Mr Trump's reliance on populist rhetoric and controversial views on immigration could lead white-collar voters to favour Mrs Clinton. For every disaffected member of the working-class he brings in, he could lose a suburban mum or college-educated businessman.
Even giving Mr Trump the benefit of the doubt, and viewing the recent polls as a trend and not a blip, there are still more electoral scenarios that end up with Mrs Clinton in the White House come 2017.
For Mr Trump, the political stars have to re-align in his favour. For Mrs Clinton, a general-election status quo likely means victory.","In the week since Donald Trump effectively secured the Republican presidential nomination, a great deal of ink and airtime have been devoted to explaining why he will have a difficult time winning the presidency in the autumn.",36270326

"The day before saw a strike ballot on career progression with the part-time Night Tube drivers and a dispute over a ""breakdown in industrial relations"" with maintenance workers.
Why? Well it seems that industrial relations are being redrawn.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would bring in a more constructive relationship with the unions.
He also promised ""zero strikes"". That didn't happen.
But I know for a fact the mayor, the transport commissioner, the TSSA and the RMT unions have met - that is in stark contrast to the previous administration.
However, with this new relationship there are now new tensions.
Transport bosses seem bemused the unions are upset over the relocation over eight drivers from Essex depots to Earl's Court.
They claim it is in black and white in the contracts agreed by the unions themselves.
They have quoted the contract: ""Your normal work location will be Leytonstone Train Crew depot Central Line.
""[London Underground Ltd] will endeavour to allocate you to an operating location convenient to you, but reserves the right to require you to work at any place it may from time to time determine within the area served by [London Underground Ltd] and London Bus Services.""
Bosses also say the new Night Tube contracts (agreed by the unions) set out that drivers must stay in their new positions for 18 months.
I put it to Peter McNaught - an Operations Director at London Underground - that this was meant to be a new era of friendlier industrial relations.
""I don't know,"" he replied.
""This one and the dispute that's just been announced on Night Tube, these are long standing agreements we have with the trade unions.
""The ink is still wet on the Night Tube agreement. The unions signed up to it and now we're in dispute about something they only agreed to five months ago.""
""I think it goes beyond London Underground and what we're doing. It's quite strange.""
The unions are clearly empowered by the new relationship.
They think the extra 325 staff agreed after the recent strikes over the station staff closures was a victory and are now pushing to achieve more for their members.
I asked John Leach from the RMT if he felt his union was now trying it on under the new mayor.
He said: ""I think it's the opposite.
""There is a disconnect between the senior management and their superior people at City Hall in my opinion.
""We're hearing that we should have better industrial relations and then when we talk to management we're up against the same old, same old.""

"That was the promise made by the Prime Minister at the weekend. But it left open a number of questions - did he mean everyone, no matter how remote, what technology will be used, and who is going to pay for it?
Here is what David Cameron said: ""Just as our forebears effectively brought gas, electricity and water to all, we're going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it.""
As the government has already promised to bring fast broadband to 95% of homes via the BDUK programme, this is all about reaching the final 5%.
The digital minister Ed Vaizey gave further detail, explaining that the plan was to bring in a universal service obligation of 10Mbps for ""the very hardest to reach homes and businesses.""
But does that mean every home - even those up Welsh mountains or on remote Scottish islands?
Let's presume it does, though just as with the obligation on BT to provide a phone line, there may be some upper limit on the costs involved in hooking up a home.
Broadband campaigners have not greeted the government's pledge with huge enthusiasm.
In particular, they have derided that 10Mbps minimum as woefully inadequate.
I contacted a number of them to ask what the minimum speed should be and got answers ranging from 15Mbps to 100Mbps.
There was also general agreement that fibre to the home was the technology which should be employed, though a few pointed out that 4G was now providing better speeds in some areas than fixed line broadband.
The problem is that, even at a minimum 10Mbps, a universal service may prove an expensive undertaking and the cost of putting a 100Mbps fibre connection in every corner of the UK could be prohibitive.
When the debate about fast broadband got going, it was calculated that universal coverage might cost at least Â£15 billion.
A  government which is implementing severe cuts in public spending will not be keen to put more money into broadband - although of course it is worth remembering that most of the cash spent so far on the BDUK programme has come from the TV licence fee.
And just about all of that spending has been channelled through BT, which was the only company to apply for the money in most regions.
Now the former monopoly telephone supplier looks likely to be a the centre of the effort to hook up the last 5%.
But even if the government wanted to spend taxpayer funds to make that happen, there will be resistance from BT's rivals.
Virgin Media has already called for an end to subsidies for rural broadband, claiming the market can now do the job - although it isn't clear that it will be moving to offer cable to every remote home.
Meanwhile, there are signs of a split opening up between town and country over the subsidy issue.
The director of the free market Institute of Economic Affairs Mark Littlewood told Radio 4's PM that people living in remote rural areas had made that choice, and fast broadband should not be a right.
Rural broadband campaigners hit back.
John  Popham, who advises rural communities wanting to get connected, told me there was already a widening gap between town and country: ""For me the issue is that urban connections are getting faster. Stuff is then developed to take advantage of those fast connections which is then inaccessible to rural users.""
Many of those campaigners have been deeply sceptical about BT's strategy for rolling out fast broadband, and some have joined calls for its Openreach division, which operates the fibre and copper networks, to be sold off.
But here's the paradox - the move to make fast broadband a right for everyone could end up strengthening BT's hand. If it is asked to meet a Universal Service Obligation, without being offered subsidies to make that feasible, then the company will want something in return.
It is Ofcom, not ministers, which is currently pondering whether Openreach should be sold off.
But the regulator will be hearing strong arguments that a divided BT will not be in good shape to help the Prime Minister fulfil his promises on fast broadband.","So, every home and business across the UK can now have fast broadband if they want it.",34765091

"When Peter Young was in charge of mental health services at Australia's refugee detention centres, he says it became increasingly clear that authorities wanted to ""keep the lid"" on health issues that asylum seekers were experiencing.
The senior Australian psychiatrist says immigration authorities wanted details about the high rates of mental illness among children at the centres to be removed from his official reports.
He was asked to delete clinical opinions that made a direct link between prolonged detention and mental health problems.
Dr Young was director of International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) - a private health service contracted by Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) to provide health care to detention centres - a role he held for three years.
Its services covered the country's controversial offshore facilities on the Pacific island of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, where all asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are sent - never to be resettled in Australia even if their refugee claims are proven.
In advising on treatment, Dr Young argued with authorities who considered acts of self-harm by detainees as ""a type of bad behaviour, rather than a manifestation of people in extreme states of hopelessness"".
He says he was later refused permission to use data he had collected about health issues in detention centres in presentations or publications.
""They made it very clear this type of information should never get into the public domain,"" he told the BBC.
Now there is fear that health workers could go to prison for such revelations under new Border Force laws that threaten ""entrusted people"" with up to two years in prison if they reveal protected information about Australia's detention facilities.
In recent months, hundreds of doctors and nurses have staged public protests in cities across Australia, posing with their hands over their mouths to highlight the risk of being silenced.
Their concerns are shared by Australia's 13 peak medical groups, who have accused the government of trying to ""gag"" health professionals.
The World Medical Association has also warned the laws are ""in striking conflict with basic principles of medical ethics"".
Critics say the gag is the latest act in a ""culture of secrecy"" around tough Australian policies designed to stop boatloads of asylum seekers from arriving on Australian shores.
The government is unapologetic about its stance on ""stopping the boats""
It denies it is trying to silence doctors and nurses or that it wants to suppress health information.
The Border Force says the new laws are to protect ""operational security"" and insists robust internal mechanisms are in place through which medical concerns can be raised and addressed.
The federal Labor opposition agrees. It supported the legislation and says health workers will be protected by 'whistleblower' protections under the Commonwealth Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013.
However, legal experts say it is not clear what sort of information would be protected and there are a range of internal hurdles that could delay or deter disclosures.
That confusion alone may suit the government, says human rights lawyer George Newhouse.
""I think the government is very happy with the uncertainty around the laws and how they are likely to have a 'chilling effect' on potential whistleblowers,"" he told the BBC.
Given very restricted public access to Australian detention centres, health and social workers have been key sources of information about conditions.
Two former medical officers at the Christmas Island detention facility, last year graphically catalogued a range of health concerns in an article in the Medical Journal of Australia, saying, among other things, that ""degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents"" had occurred at the centre.
""Degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents have occurred, including requiring asylum seekers to undergo health assessments while exhausted, dehydrated and filthy, with clothing soiled by urine and faeces; addressing individuals by number instead of name, artificial delays in transfer of patients for tertiary care; confiscation and destruction of medications, medical records and medical devices; and detention of children despite clear evidence of significant harm.""
--Medical Journal of Australia, Volume 201, October 2014
Dr Young believes the risk of being sent to prison will discourage medical staff from speaking out in future, even if no prosecutions are launched.
Other detention centre practices like employing staff from developing countries who are not protected by Australian labour or whistleblower laws also ""keep the lid on all information flowing out of the system"", he says.
""My position is that the medical profession is expected to speak out when it comes to issues that harm people's health.
""There would be no controversy if I was speaking about cigarette smoking or asbestos exposure.
""The evidence is very clear that prolonged detention in such circumstances causes a negative health impact, and keeping those health impacts secret makes the situation worse.""

"NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh says he worries they will put vulnerable people ""at risk"", while chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says they will ""inevitably lead to patients suffering"" and Health Minister Ben Gummer claims they will be put in ""harm's way"".
It's easy to understand why. On 26 and 27 April junior doctors will stop providing emergency cover - unlike in the previous strikes in the contract dispute.
It means as well as downing tools for their routine duties, medics will walk out of A&E units and intensive care departments, leaving some of the sickest and most vulnerable patients in the hands of others.
But will the reality of the all-out strike be really as bad as the rhetoric? After all, the doctors' code of conduct produced by the General Medical Council decrees they must not harm patients or put them at risk.
And the British Medical Association is adamant the stoppages do not breach this code because of the contingency plans being put in place.
The union is legally bound to give the NHS seven days' notice of industrial action. In this case the health service has had five weeks.
The time has allowed hospital bosses to carefully consider what they need and put plans in place. This has been done in partnership with BMA reps, while at a national level Department of Health and NHS England officials have been meeting regularly to ensure the contingency arrangements are satisfactory . And as yet no hospital has yet said it cannot cope.
This is because large chunks of the routine work has been postponed and staff will be redeployed into emergency areas. There will be consultants, staff doctors - those who are not in training but have not yet reached consultant level - nurses, midwives and health care assistants in work.
GPs are also being asked to keep a greater number of appointments free for urgent on-the-day cases than normal, while patients will be warned in the lead-up to the strike to think carefully about how they use the health service during the stoppages.
The result is that there are plenty of people who think the system will run pretty smoothly. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Emergency Medicine have both released statements saying they are satisfied with the arrangements being put in place.
In fact, you could argue the result in some departments may be that the system may actually work better than on a normal day. Take A&E, for example. Having more consultants on the floor could actually speed up the flow of patients as they will be able to make quick decisions about the care patients need. Although there is an argument the smaller hospitals with fewer consultants may find it more difficult.
Meanwhile, in emergency surgery and intensive care the presence of consultants should, in theory, more than make up for the absence of the juniors.
Also, it should be remembered that the stoppages are from 08:00 to 17:00 BST - not for 24 or 48 hours as the previous strikes have been - so there will be some respite during the two days.
Instead, the problems might be more run of the mill. Junior doctors play a vital role chasing up test results, ordering x-rays, taking bloods, ordering prescriptions and preparing patients for discharge.
Consultants may not have the time to do some of these, their skills may be a little rusty or they may simply not know their way round the system to get on top of the jobs. Senior nurses will be able to take some of the strain, but there is bound to be disruption.
However, that doesn't mean the concerns being voiced are not justified. Talking to those who work in the service, there does seem to be a weak spot.
It concerns what happens if there is an unexpected emergency on a general or surgical ward or perhaps in a psychiatric unit. When a patient collapses, a junior doctor would normally be one of the first on the scene.
If they aren't there and a patient dies, questions will be naturally asked.  And this, perhaps, is the crux of the matter.
It was a point made by Prof Lord Darzi of Denham, a surgeon and former health minister, in an article in the Daily Telegraph.. He wrote that every family afflicted with heartbreak on the strike days ""would always wonder"" whether loved ones would have lived if junior doctors had been there. Trust between doctors and society might be ""irreparably damaged"", he warned.
This blog was first published on 15 April, but has since been updated to take into account subsequent developments.

"Growing up in diamond-rich eastern Sierra Leone, it was the natural thing to do.
Jobs were, and still are, few and far between, so the gemstones were a magnet. They persuaded many to drop out of school, but I worked as a miner mostly during school holidays and sometimes at weekends.
The Kono District was densely populated because the sparkling stones could be found virtually everywhere, sometimes through sheer luck.
My parents joined thousands of people from across the country, as well as The Gambia, Mali, Senegal and even Lebanon, to go to Kono in the hope of making a quick fortune.
Blistered palms
I grew up there and my work as a miner was hard. I dug the river beds for gravel and extracted the often muddy earth looking for diamonds.
The pickaxes and shovels would blister my palms and the sieve would harden or even deaden my fingers, often breaking my fingernails.
And because I had to also lift sacks full of dry red tropical gravel, my head and neck were almost always in pain.
Diamond deposits were sometimes so close to the surface in parts of Kono that it was common for people to pick up tiny gemstones that had been loosened by a heavy downpour.
I found a tiny stone once or twice in my birthplace, Bumpeh. I did not know their true worth, but got enough money to see me through for about a week.
1. Cullinan Diamond, found in South Africa in 1905, weighed 3,107 carats
2. Lesedi La Rona, found in Botswana in 2015, weighed 1,111 carats
3. Excelsior Diamond, found in South Africa in 1893, weighed 995 carats
4. Star of Sierra Leone, found in Sierra Leone in 1972, weighed 969 carats
5. Incomparable Diamond, found in DR Congo in 1984, weighed 890 carats
Source: Mathew Nyaungwa, Rough and Polished
After doing my school-leaving exams, I took to full-scale mining to help pay for my university studies.
Apart from mining in Kono, I also went to Tongo Fields in neighbouring Kenema District. There, I discovered that the life of an artisanal miner was like that of an indentured labourer.
Diamond diggers generally had two layers of sponsorship, and still do. The Group of Geng, or Gang, is what the diggers are called.
In language which harks back to the days of slavery, each group has a Master who looks over them. He is also in charge of providing food, accommodation and medicine.
But when I was there, conditions were such that only one square meal a day was assured - and please do not ask how the sauce tasted.
We often slept on the floor of a room or veranda, with bedbugs and mosquitoes biting us in turns. As for health care, Panadol was all we would get if we fell ill.
Then there was the Supporter - the person who would provide the funds for the Master.
We rarely got to know him personally. He tended to be a big businessman or diamond dealer, and he provided us with tools and monthly allowances.
Like me, most diggers did not know - and still do not know - the real value of their diamonds. So, it was easy for the Master and the Supporter to connive and dupe us about the price.
There is a group known as Gado Geng. They prefer to sponsor themselves and sell their diamonds on their own.
But my three-member team had a Master. We worked on a licensed plot.
However, one day, we went to do illicit mining at an abandoned site belonging to the then state-owned National Diamond Mining Company.
Two of us were on the sieve, the third shovelling the pile of gravel. I was busy shaking the sieve under the water to wash the mud off the stones.
Then I saw a sparkling object right in the middle of the sieve.
I was not sure if it was a diamond or corundum, a sparkling stone that has little value. I brought up the sieve, to be sure.
I went straight to the spot to try to separate it from the rest of the stones and sand.
My heart pounded. I excitedly muttered to my colleagues: ""Na diamond,"" a Krio phrase for ""It's a diamond"".
I made sure that I did not say it loudly for fear that someone in the distance would hear me.
My colleague, Yarpo, dropped the bucket and shovel to verify my find. He agreed that it was a diamond.
We flung the tools away and dashed into the tall swampy grass. We then fled before anyone could catch us.
Obviously, we kept our Master in the dark and sold the two-carat diamond to a local dealer for 100,000 leone. I am not sure how many US dollars that was worth in 1991, but it was a lot of money.
I was the youngest, but the other two diggers treated me fairly.  We split the money, and they gave me 34,000 leone, a little more than my share.
Unlike many other diamond diggers, I did not waste any of it on buying brightly-coloured sneakers, jeans, shirts or cassette players.
I had a clear idea what I was going to do with it - pay my first year university fee of around 24,000 leone.
Dream fulfilled
As I was still awaiting my school exam results, I  gave the money to my aunt to add to her capital and do some business.
I went back to concentrate on mining, but it turned out to be the last time that fortune would smile on me as a digger.
I always wanted to become a journalist as I was born with the BBC World Service blaring in our home.
My dad, who never went to school, was addicted to it. And there were old newspapers and magazines lined up under his mattress and piled up elsewhere in his tiny bedroom.
However, Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College did not offer journalism at the time. So, my instinct told me to study English and French for an international edge.
I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and went on to work as journalist.
Like me, my children have grown up with the BBC World Service , except that my voice is among the voices that they hear.","In my teens, I worked as an artisanal miner, waist deep in water, sieving the gravel to find a diamond.",39478462
"El Mundo said it had original ledger entries handwritten by the former treasurer of the governing Popular Party (PP), Luis Barcenas.
It said it had delivered the documents to the High Court.
Mr Rajoy and other PP members have repeatedly denied that they received illegal payments.
Another Spanish paper, El Pais, published similar documents earlier this year.
It is claimed that Mr Barcenas ran a PP slush fund that took donations from construction magnates and distributed them to party leaders in cash.
Mr Barcenas is in custody facing trial for corruption and tax fraud. He denies the allegations.
However, in an interview published in El Mundo on Sunday, Mr Barcenas for the first time admitted that the handwriting in the ledger was his.
He added that the photocopies originally published by El Pais were a fraction of the documents he had in his possession.
El Mundo said the documents it had seen showed that Mr Rajoy received payments in 1997, 1998 and 1999 when he was a minister in the government of Jose Maria Aznar.
They included, it said, two payments to Mr Rajoy of 2.1m pesetas (12,600 euros; Â£11,000) in 1998.
The alleged payments are said to have been undeclared and untaxed.
Spanish opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba in February called on Mariano Rajoy to resign over the allegations.
""The Luis Barcenas originals published by El Mundo today pulverise the alibi used until now by the PP to deny the authenticity of its ex-treasurer's papers,"" El Mundo said.
The PP responded with a statement saying:  ""The Popular Party reiterates that it does not know of the notes nor their content, and it does not in any way recognise them as the accounts of this political organisation.""
This is another twist in possibly the most important corruption scandal to hit modern Spanish politics, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Madrid.

"Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week.
And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture.
""He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in,"" McCarthy told BBC Scotland.
""Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner.
""He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good.
""Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now.""
As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic.
Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble.
""I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong,"" McCarthy said. ""It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money.""
Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons.
He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013.
There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers.
Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old.
""He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years,"" he added. ""The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season.""
And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees.
""Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example,"" McCarthy added.
""He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence.""",Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.,40143695

"He also suggested they should not be eligible for tax credits.
It comes as a survey suggests 77% of Britons want to see immigration cut.
The coalition brought in a three month ban on EU citizens getting out-of-work benefits ahead of work restrictions being lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians on 1 January.
But Mr Farage, whose party fought the last election on a policy of halting immigration for five years, said the government should go much further.
He said the cost of migrants claiming in-work welfare payments, such as child benefit, housing benefit and tax credits, had not been factored in to the government's calculations.
""We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits,"" he told BBC News.
And he said lower economic growth was a price worth paying for cutting immigration.
""Even if I thought, which I don't, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.""
London Mayor Boris Johnson also weighed in to the debate, suggesting the ban on EU citizens claiming benefits should be two years.
Labour said it supported the government's three-month ban, which it said was ""reasonable and achievable"".
Downing Street said withholding benefits from migrants for longer periods may be illegal.
""We are doing all that we can within the law,"" said a No 10 spokesman.
Downing Street also confirmed ministers were examining measures to curb the ability of migrants to claim child benefit for children in their native countries.
The British Social Attitudes Survey suggests more than three-quarters of Britons want to see a cut in immigration - and 56% want to see a major crackdown.
Almost half of those surveyed, 47%, thought immigration was bad for the economy, and among the 31% of respondents who said it was good for the economy, half wanted to see immigration reduced anyway.
The figures are revealed in a BBC Two documentary called The Truth About Immigration, to be broadcast later on Tuesday.
Business Secretary Vince Cable tells the programme the government's target of cutting net migration to below 100,000 by 2015 is ""not helpful"" and will almost certainly not be achieved.
Mr Cable, who has sought to distance himself from the net migration target in the past, calling it a Conservative and not a coalition policy, said politicians on all sides must be ""practical"" and accept that net migration cannot be controlled.
""It involves British people emigrating - you can't control that. It involves free movement within the European Union - in and out. It involves British people coming back from overseas who are not immigrants but are counted in the numbers,"" he says.
""Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful. It almost certainly won't achieve the below-100,000 level the Conservatives are setting - so let's be practical about it.""
Labour said the ""gap between the government's rhetoric and reality on immigration is continuing to undermine public confidence"".
Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said Mr Cable should toughen up enforcement of the minimum wage and prevent employment agencies recruiting solely from abroad.
David Cameron promised to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those emigrating -  from more than 250,000 a year to less than 100,000 by the next election in 2015.
After some initial success, the latest figures show net migration is on the rise again, going up from 167,000 to 182,000 a year, largely because fewer Britons were emigrating to eurozone countries.
Asked last month if that meant it would be impossible to meet his target, Mr Cameron said: ""'I don't accept that.""
""If you take the whole three-year period [since the election], net immigration is down by around third.""
He said some measures the government had taken, such as closing ""bogus"" colleges and tightening up the rules on family reunion, would take time to have an impact.
In Nick Robinson's documentary, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says the Labour government of which he was a prominent member ""got it wrong"" on immigration, ""and I deeply regret it"".
Labour MP and former Home Secretary David Blunkett adds: ""We didn't spell out in words of one syllable what was happening, partly because of a fear of racism.""
Nigel Farage tells the programme: ""They tried to rubbish us, they tried to say that anybody that dared to talk about this subject was necessarily a bad person and racist, that was what they tried to do and actually this has been going on ever since [Enoch] Powell's speech.""
In the so-called ""rivers of blood"" speech, made in 1968, Mr Powell said Britain's immigration policy was like watching a nation ""heaping up its own funeral pyre"".
He was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet by party leader Edward Heath, who said it was ""inflammatory and liable to damage race relations"".
Asked whether he thought Mr Powell had been right, Mr Farage says: ""He was right for the wrong reasons. He was wrong in the sense that he felt that black and white would find it difficult to mix, but unfortunately he's been proved to be right because the sheer numbers that have come into Britain have led to segregation.""
BBC political editor Nick Robinson says all political parties now ""promise to control"" immigration because they are ""acutely aware of the high level of public concern"" about it.
In the programme, he looks back to a civil service paper published in 2001 which examined the economic and the social impact of immigration.
The paper concluded that there was ""little evidence that native workers are harmed by migration"".
Its author, former Cabinet Office economist Jonathan Portes, said: ""I think politicians do have to say to individuals who are negatively affected, and let's face it there will be some: 'Yes, we're doing this for the good of our country, and yes you may lose out, but ultimately we still have to do this.'
""Just as we said to the coal miners 30 years ago: 'Sorry we can get our coal a lot cheaper abroad. We can't afford to keep on propping you up.'""

"Drivers face being given six penalty points on their licence rather than three, and a Â£200 fine instead of Â£100.
But figures obtained by BBC Radio Wales showed 166 motorists were stopped by police for using their phones in March - up from 137 in February.
The Handsoff campaign said driving and using a phone is a ""lethal cocktail"".
The changes to the law, introduced on 1 March, mean new drivers caught using a mobile phone face losing their licence, and more experienced drivers can be banned if they get 12 points in three years.
Lucy Amos, from road safety charity Brake, said: ""Mobile phone use behind the wheel is a growing menace and it's time we got tough with those who break the law.
""These drivers are putting their own and other people's lives in grave danger.
""As a charity that supports bereaved and seriously injured road crash victims we know only too well the devastation and heartbreak caused by distracted drivers and have been campaigning on this issue for a number of years.
""We would also like to see a total ban on phone use as even using hands-free increases your likelihood of being involved in a crash. It's the distraction of the conversation that's the main danger.""
She added mobile phone use should be as big a taboo as drink driving.
A spokesman for Mobile UK, the trade association for the UK's mobile operators, told the Jason Mohammad programme the UK government had been taking the lead on action to tackle the issue.
""Mobile UK and mobile operators have been supportive of the measures that respective governments have been doing to reduce hand-held mobile phone use in vehicles but government have very much been taking the lead,"" he said.

"The interior ministry confirmed his replacement as Abdul Rahman Rahimi, former police chief in Balkh province.
Gen Zahir resigned last week after presiding over a dramatic rise in militant attacks in recent months.
His spokesman sparked confusion days later by claiming his resignation had been rejected.
Interior ministry spokesman Sidiq Sidiqi said: ""Abdul Rahman Rahimi, the former police chief of Balkh, is appointed as Kabul police chief and General Zahir is appointed as the head of the counter crime department.
""So far no-one is appointed as Balkh police chief and soon another general will be appointed there.""
Gen Zahir gave no reason for his resignation, but he had faced increasing pressure, with insurgents carrying out nine deadly attacks in Kabul in the past two weeks.
The latest in a string of attacks targeted a compound used by a US-based charity on Saturday, killing three South Africans.
Last week, two American soldiers and two British embassy workers were killed in separate attacks, with dozens of Afghans also killed and injured.
Gen Zahir was himself the target of an attack in early November, when a suicide bomber infiltrated his offices and killed his deputy.
Afghan troops are preparing to take over national security before the withdrawal of foreign combat troops at the end of the month.

""I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game.""

Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to ""face this issue head-on"".

"British police accuse him of stealing $250m (£160m) over eight years.
The prosecutor called him a ""thief in government house"".
Ibori, once seen as one of Nigeria's wealthiest and most influential politicians, was arrested in 2010 in Dubai and then extradited to London.
Some $35m of his alleged UK assets were frozen in 2007.
As his trial at London's Southwark Crown Court was about to begin, Mr Ibori changed his plea to guilty and admitted stealing money from Delta state and laundering it in London through a number of offshore companies.
The BBC's Chris Summers says between 20 and 30 of Mr Ibori's supporters turned up to court - some wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Free Ibori"". There was not enough room for them all in the public gallery.
Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had ""tricked"" his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record.
""He was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state's wealth and hand out patronage.""
He is due to be sentenced on 16 April.
Ibori's wife, Theresa, his sister, Christine, his mistress, Udoamaaka Okoronkwo, and his London solicitor, Bhadresh Gohil, have all been convicted of money-laundering.
Their convictions could only be reported on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted.
Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK's Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor's financial affairs.
""The vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori's lavish lifestyle,"" Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said.
""We will now be actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta State.""
He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world.
Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London - he paid £2.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion - and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say.
Three of the money-laundering charges relate to the sale of Delta state's share in mobile phone company V-Mobile to neighbouring Akwa Ibom state.
This raised $37m which Ibori stole and laundered through his solicitor Gohil, who has been jailed for 10 years.
In 2007, a UK court froze assets allegedly belonging to him worth $35m.
His annual salary as Delta state governor was less than $25,000.
He had already left the UK when his assets were seized but he was arrested in Nigeria later that year.
The charges were dismissed but he was then re-arrested in Dubai on a British warrant.
Ibori has been convicted in the UK before - in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes.
He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590.
Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers. Under its federal system, state governors enjoy huge powers and control budgets larger than those of many West African countries.

Crispr-Cas9 is a DNA cutting and pasting system scientists have borrowed from nature.
Bacteria use it to protect themselves against foreign DNA from viruses.
Scientists have already begun using it in the lab to target and cut out faulty DNA in human cells that cause illnesses.
But it is not without risks.
While effective, the editing process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA.
These unwanted or ""off-target"" edits could alter other important genes, inadvertently triggering cancer, for example.
Dr Chris Lord, a gene expert at the Institute of Cancer Research, said: """"The key to translating this technique into the clinic will be to see how specific to the tumour cell the Crispr activation will be and how specific, in terms of genes, the Crispr-mediated gene cutting will be.
""These are essentially the same two issues you have with all cancer treatments - how specific for the tumour cell and how specific for the target.""",Scientists have used a gene-editing tool to stunt tumour growth in mice.,37279430
"Italian media say two families were living in the four-storey building that collapsed in Torre Annunziata district. Two children are among those missing.
The cause remains unclear. Neighbours did not report hearing any explosion - just the crash of masonry at dawn.
Some masonry fell on the nearby Naples-Salerno railway line, so traffic on it has been suspended.
It is a seismically active area but there is no suggestion that an earth tremor jolted the building.
There are suspicions that the collapse could be linked to vibrations from the railway, or to renovation work that was under way on the lower floors.",Rescuers in southern Italy are trying to find eight people missing after an apartment block collapsed in Naples.,40529527
"The band have revealed they were asked to write a signature tune for the movie, but it ""didn't work out"" and the song was not used.
Sam Smith's Writing's On The Wall ended up as the movie's theme song instead.
Radiohead have now made their brooding, orchestral song, titled Spectre, available as a free download on Soundcloud.
Singer Thom Yorke wrote on Twitter: ""Last year we were asked to write a theme tune for the Bond movie Spectre.
""Yes we were. It didn't work out, but became something of our own, which we love very much.
""As the year closes we thought you might like to hear it. Merry Christmas. May the force be with you.""
Many fans expressed their approval on Twitter. Music critic Pete Paphides was among them, writing: ""It sounds exquisite on first listen, sensational string arrangement.""
Before Spectre came out in October, there had been speculation that Radiohead had been chosen for the coveted task of recording the theme tune.
In July, one bookmaker suspended betting on the identity of the act that had recorded the theme after one punter tried to bet Â£15,000 on Radiohead.
Bond actor Daniel Craig is known to be a fan of the band, having quizzed Yorke for Interview magazine in 2013.
Sam Smith's theme received mixed reviews when it was released in September, with BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson saying it was ""good enough, but not a classic"".
But former Bond actor Sir Roger Moore called Writing's On the Wall ""very haunting and wonderfully orchestrated"".
The song made history by becoming the first Bond theme to reach number one in the UK, achieving combined chart sales and streams of 70,000 copies.
Smith was the first solo male British act to perform a Bond film's theme song since 1964, when Tom Jones was heard over the opening credits of Thunderball.",Radiohead have released the song they recorded to be the theme for the latest James Bond movie Spectre.,35178921
"This afternoon, the Labour leader returned to the stage - in shirt sleeves this time - to face questions from his audience.
One introduced herself: ""Christina Rees, newly-elected Labour councillor for Bridgend.""
So far so good. But then it got trickier.
""And you haven't kissed me, Ed, but you kissed Barbara yesterday and I'm extremely jealous,"" joked Christina.
A look of mock alarm came over the leader's face as he assured delegates: ""Don't get the wrong idea by the way.""
Christina told her leader how Labour had won a by-election in Bettws: ""The Tories only got 12 votes!""
Ed Miliband started to look concerned: ""Don't give us all the Bridgend results because we might be here.....""
He cut swiftly to his next questioner - Barbara Jones, from Caerphilly, who introduced herself thus: ""I am the lucky one that got the kiss yesterday and I've had so many texts you wouldn't believe it.""
Had he not been wearing television make-up, Ed Miliband surely would have blushed. Instead, he briefly referred to delegates as ""comrades"" for the first time, while imploring Barbara to move on.
Barbara moved on, but 24 hours into the era of ""one nation Labour"" the leader has discovered that you can't please all the people all the time.","Ed Miliband may have wowed delegates with his ""look - no notes"" speech to the Labour conference but not everyone is going home happy.",19821003
"Keane, 23, who has played for England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels, will report to St George's Park on Tuesday with the rest of the squad.
Gareth Southgate called him up after Johnson was ruled out of Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Malta.
On Monday, Andros Townsend replaced the injured Raheem Sterling in the squad.

"Defence attaché Capt Oleg Kornienko presented Ushakov medals to the men of the Arctic Convoys.
Able seaman Charles Lewis, 91, from Calmore, Hampshire said he was ""honoured and delighted"".
The Foreign Office initially did not allow Russia to honour the veterans as it broke the rules on foreign medals.
The Russian embassy said the convoys allowed Russian soldiers to defeat the Germans on the Eastern Front.
Mr Lewis said: ""I certainly don't see myself as a hero - far from it - and I think all my friends and colleagues, many of whom sadly are no longer with us, would regard us as simply doing our bit for the war effort.
""Although I have to say that Churchill's famous quote about the Arctic convoys' missions through the North Sea in winter as being 'the worst journey on earth' did strike a chord  - then and now.""
•They consisted of vessels which travelled from Britain to northern Russia to resupply the Soviet Union during World War II
•Under constant threat of attack by German U-boats and aircraft, the craft also had to deal with severe cold, storms, and ice floes
•By May 1945, the Arctic route had claimed 104 merchant and 16 military vessels. Thousands of Allied seamen lost their lives

Minister-Councillor Alexander Kramarenko from the Russian Embassy said: ""It [the ceremony] is done for them because they have been expecting for a very long time to be recognized.
""It is done for us as it was important for us.
""The arctic convoy was a material expression of our wartime alliance and they provided weapons and ammunition that armed us to defeat the Germans on the Eastern front.
""We and Britain were in it together.""
More than 3,000 men died during the maritime campaign that Winston Churchill was said to have called the ""worst journey in the world"".
The Russian Embassy wrote to survivors in May 2012 that it intended to award them with the Medal of Ushakov as a symbol of the country's gratitude.
But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago.
The British Government created the Arctic Star in 2012 following a long campaign for the convoy veterans to be recognised.
But campaigners believed veterans should still be able to receive the Russian accolade.
The Foreign Office allowed an ""exception to the rules"" last year and President Vladimir Putin presented the first medals during his visit to London on 16 June 2013.

"Indonesian jazz pianist Joey Alexander is the youngest performer ever to be nominated for the prestigious music award.
He did not win a Grammy but while the young musician performed on stage, the cameras panned across to singer Bruno Mars, who was watching with glistening eyes.
Many from Joey's homeland also expressed their admiration and support for the young star.
You were definitely the star of the show,"" tweeted Indonesian music composer Sherina Sinna. Movie-maker Joko Anwar also described him as a ""hope"".
Josiah Alexander Sila was born in Bali's Denpasar city to Christian parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran a tourism business.
His parents have described their son's talents as a ""gift from God"".
There were no formal jazz classes in Bali where he grew up, so the young musician took part in jazz sessions with more experienced performers.
It was then that his parents decided to make the move to the Indonesian capital Jakarta - home to one of the world's largest jazz festivals - to pursue Joey's musical dream.
He went on to win music competitions before his family moved to New York in 2014.
The child prodigy taught himself to play piano at age six, after his father bought him an electronic keyboard.
Joey has said that learning music came naturally for him, thanks to listening to songs from his father's personal jazz collection.
""My dad played a little bit of piano and guitar, but not that professionally,"" Joey said in an early interview, about falling in love with the piano.
""I saw him play and I said, 'I want to play. I want to try this instrument.'""
The young musician considers Harry Connick, Jr. and Herbie Hancock among his main musical influences, and also admires Clifford Brown and Miles Davis.
There could be something in the blood because he is also the nephew of Indonesian rock singer Nafa Urbach.
Renowned Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, discovered Joey after seeing him perform in a YouTube video in 2014.
Praising the young pianist on Facebook, he then invited him to play at the Jazz at Lincoln Center's gala, making him him an ""overnight sensation"".
Joey went on to make his US debut, performing at several Jazz festivals.
Joey's debut album titled, ""My Favourite Things"" was released on 12 May, 2015. He was 11 years old at the time of its release.
He  became the first Indonesian act to crack the US Billboard album charts, debuting at number 174.

"The queue at St Ann's Square to lay tributes to those killed and injured in the attack stretches back about 260ft (80m) from the church to the Royal Exchange Theatre, as people wait patiently to quietly reflect on what had happened in a place so familiar and ""close to home"".
Elsewhere in the city centre though, it is like any other Saturday, with bustling shoppers on Market Street, children playing in Piccadilly Gardens' fountains and people gathering to listen to street performers.
It is a city in flux and one which is now, as with the rest of the nation, back in the grip of general election campaigning, following the three-day pause in the wake of the terror attack.
But is Manchester ready to move on and talk politics?
Kelly, 38, from Manchester and Donna, 37, from Rochdale came to St Ann's Square to pay their respects after the attack, which was ""beyond belief"".
For Kelly, it is ""too soon"" to restart campaigning.
""I think it's become all about this. I think it's become all about religion and I think they should hold off a bit longer frankly.
""It's become too personal.""
Donna agrees that people are not ""ready"".
""People are still reeling from all this. It's the last thing on anybody's mind.
""People have died. People are angry about it, they're making the wrong choices because they're angry.
""I don't think people are going to have the time to sit and think 'what is right for them in their votes' with a clear head.
""People are in shock, still.""
Swapna and Anik Kali, 28, live round the corner from the Manchester Arena and believe life must go on, even if that means political campaigning.
However, Anik warns that ""politicians should not take advantage by commenting on anything... that's the only thing we can think about, whether it's early or not - it should not be a political issue"".
Swapna adds that what happened ""should not stop us doing anything"".
""After everything that happened, everything was so sad, but [we] are definitely still here and enjoying and... holding up.""
Emma, 27, from Runcorn says the city centre ""is exactly the same as it always is"".
""We can't be afraid [and] we can't let it stop us.
""[The election] is coming up so close now and it's such an important one this year.
""There are so many young people who have registered to vote now. It's really important to carry on.""
James and Danielle Yates arrived in Manchester from the West Midlands alongside more than 100 other bikers to ""pay tribute"" to the victims of the attack.
James, 35, said it felt ""very soon"" to start campaigning again.
""There are other things to be doing than thinking about politics at the minute.
""I don't think it'll change anything in the election campaign, [but] let people get over it a bit first.
But 33-year-old Chris, who lives in Salford Quays, disagrees, saying that ""it needed to start again, because they are running out of time"".
""I think they've done well and not used it, but I think it is the right thing to do, because this is a really important election.
""I think security, police, a lot more stuff about online snooping will be coming up.""
He adds that seeing Manchester ""nice and busy was reassuring"".
""There is a really nice atmosphere. Like 'no, it doesn't get to us, we're still living'.
""Life still goes on [and] I think the city is moving on. It is defiance.

"The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she was ""swept off my feet"" when she was contacted by a man she believed to be in Turkey.
She lost her home, business and took out several loans over 14 months.
She said: ""The pressure was horrendous, and it got to the point where all the money had gone.""
More on this and other York stories
Speaking to BBC Radio York, the woman, known as Nancy, said she had come out of a ""bad marriage"" and joined dating website Match.com ""to dip my toe into the dating world"".
In July 2015, she received her first message.
Nancy, from North Yorkshire, said: ""I just connected with what seemed to be a very attractive-looking person who was really keen to talk to me.
""There's a term for it - lovebombed - where you're just bombarded with affection and compliments.
""When you're with someone who tells you how awful you are every day for ten years, then someone pays you some compliments... of course you're going to be swept away.""
After chatting for six weeks online, they then began talking via another messaging service, and she was asked for money.
She was told the man and his young son had been attacked and mugged, with the boy requiring ""urgent medical care"".
""It was a really bizarre amount of money, it was €3,750, it wasn't a straightforward amount of money I would have normally associated with a fraud,"" she said.
""Reluctantly I sent the money, because I couldn't think of a child in distress and we seemed to be getting on really well.""
Nancy said she was ""bombarded"" with messages from the moment she woke up to when she went to sleep, with further requests for money coming in.
She did not tell anyone about what she was experiencing.
Nancy said: ""As soon as the money requests came through it was posed to me that I shouldn't tell anybody because it would look really bad, nobody would understand.""
Action Fraud advice
Nancy continued: ""I came from one abusive relationship and went straight back into another one.
""The manipulation was so extreme that I was told that if I didn't send money, they would starve and die. I didn't want that on my conscience.
""You get to the point where you have lost so much money, you have to keep going in the hope that you're wrong.""
After reading fraud advice online, Nancy went to police at the start of September, but by this time, more than £300,000 had gone.
No arrests have been made over the crime, also known as 'catfishing'.
Nancy added: ""I've got no house and huge debts, but the pressure has now gone.

"The leftist Syriza government's surprise decision to call that vote scuppered its bailout talks with eurozone ministers.
The Greeks have very little time to prepare for a referendum whose outcome could decide their future in the euro.
What is the point of the referendum?
The government says the EU-IMF bailout terms are unacceptable, but cannot simply be rejected without the Greek people having their say.
The issue is so important for Greece's future that ""we decided to turn to the citizens, to explain our negative attitude to it [the bailout], but to give them the choice"", Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, in a letter to eurozone leaders leaked by the Financial Times, said holding a referendum ""is a sovereign democratic right of the Greek people, necessary to ensure ownership over the financial assistance programme that will be eventually agreed with the institutions"".
He told the Greek people that the lenders had resorted to ""blackmail"" in order to impose more austerity.
After five years of recession and welfare cuts many ordinary Greeks feel bitter that they have suffered while Europe's business elite recovered quickly from the financial crisis.
More than democracy is at stake - a vote to reject the bailout could trigger a ""Grexit"", a Greek exit from the euro.
A No vote would formally cut the euro pipeline from lenders, and the Greek government could be forced to issue IOUs or a ""new drachma"" currency to prevent a banking collapse.
However, the EU has no mechanism for a country to leave the euro - it has never happened before.
What will the question be?
The language is quite technical, and many Greeks may struggle to understand it:
""Should the proposed agreement be accepted, which was submitted by the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund in the Eurogroup of 25.06.2015 and consists of two parts, which constitute their unified proposal?
""The first document is entitled 'Reforms for the Completion of the Current Program and Beyond' and the second 'Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis'.""
Beside the question are two boxes: ""Not approved/No; Approved/Yes"".
Uncertainty still surrounds the referendum. Mr Tsipras's political opponents say he has not told the Greek public exactly what the lenders were proposing, and what in particular he rejected.
It is not impossible that Greece's tortuous negotiations with lenders could resume in the coming days.
And the current bailout expires on Tuesday - the day that Greece is supposed to pay back €1.6bn (£1.1bn; $1.8bn) to the International Monetary Fund.
Greece is teetering on the brink of default, and if that happens events could unfold dramatically before 5 July.
Who wants a No vote in the referendum?
Syriza, the nationalist Independent Greeks, and far-right Golden Dawn say ""No"" to the bailout terms.
Opposition parties object to holding a referendum, and their supporters are likely to vote ""Yes"" or abstain.
The main opposition parties are New Democracy (centre-right), To Potami (centrist) and Pasok (centre-left).
What was the lenders' reaction?
Anger. Eurozone finance ministers had been preparing for last-ditch talks on 27 June to hammer out a deal on reforms. Agreement would mean releasing the final €7.2bn bailout instalment that Greece desperately needs.
But Mr Tsipras pulled his delegates out of talks the night before and announced the referendum.
In an unusual move, the European Commission later published the detailed reforms that it wanted to negotiate with Greece.
But the Commission complained that ""neither this latest version of the document, nor an outline of a comprehensive deal could be formally finalised and presented to the Eurogroup due to the unilateral decision of the Greek authorities to abandon the process"".
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he felt betrayed by Mr Tsipras's move. ""Playing off one democracy against 18 others is not an attitude which is fitting for the great Greek nation,"" he said.
IMF chief Christine Lagarde said any referendum would relate to ""proposals and arrangements which are no longer valid"".
Lenders' proposals - key sticking points
Source: European Commission document, 26 Jun 15 (pdf)
Why couldn't Greece get a bailout extension?
There remains a big gap between what the lenders want and the Greek government's agenda.
Syriza - a grassroots coalition of leftists - won elections in January promising to end austerity.
The price for Greece's massive €240bn bailout, which started in 2010, was austerity. The budget cuts demanded by the lenders have thrown many Greeks into hardship and a quarter of the workforce is unemployed.
Syriza has urged the lenders to release the last €7.2bn of bailout money. But the lenders say Greece must agree to widen the scope of its sales tax (VAT) - to boost revenue - and drastically reduce the numbers entitled to early retirement. The pension system is unsustainable, they argue.
Those are the main sticking points, but the lenders also want much more action against corruption and tax evasion.
The lenders are not convinced by Syriza's tax income projections. They also suspect that Syriza is unwilling to reform deeply-entrenched working practices.","Greece's cash-strapped banks are to remain shut for a week, until after a key 5 July referendum on the country's bailout conditions.",33314442

"Leng Ouch gathered evidence to highlight how land concessions (ELCs) were being abused and forcing communities from their homes.
His outspoken criticism of the government led to fears for his safety, forcing Mr Ouch into hiding.
In 2014, the government cancelled ELCs that covered 89,000 hectares of forest.
Despite this, Mr Ouch said he felt the plight of the nation's forests was not improving.
""The situation is getting worse year after year,"" he told BBC News.
""There is no improvement, there is more destruction. There is more deforestation and more demand from overseas.
""We have lost millions of hectares of land through the land concessions.""
It is reported that Cambodia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and just 20-30% of its original forest cover remains.
One of the driving forces is the demand from nations like China for high-value hardwoods, such as Siamese rosewood that can fetch US $50,000 (Â£35,000) for a cubic metre.
Another cause for the high deforestation rate is the introduction of Economic Land Concessions (ELCs) in 2001, which were designed to support economy-boosting large-scale agriculture, such as rubber and sugar plantations.
However, the issuing of the ELCs has affected many communities that depended on the land for their livelihoods.
Campaigners say that more than 700,000 people have been driven from their homes as a result of ELCs.
Leng Ouch's work has taken him undercover and placed him in extreme danger as he attempted to gather evidence of the impact of the ELCs on forests and forest people.
Posing as a labourer, he was able to shed light how the land concessions were being used to provide cover for illegal operations.
In 2012, a moratorium was imposed on ELCs, but Mr Ouch argued that it did not go far enough and did not stop forests being felled and people being displaced.
Mr Ouch explained why he had spent more than two decades investigating and campaigning to highlight the injustices he felt he had witnessed.
""There are not many people in Cambodia that do this kind of work and I felt it was necessary for me to step in and defend and protect the forests,"" he observed.
However, he was aware of the dangers of being an environmental campaigner in Cambodia and had often gone into hiding in order to avoid unwanted attention and threats to his life.
Winning a globally prestigious environmental prize does not remove the dangers. In March, Berta Caceres - a 2015 Gold Prize winner - was killed by gunmen in Honduras. She had been a vocal campaigner against a project to build a massive dam across the Gualcarque River.
He said he was excited to be one of this year's winners of the Goldman Environmental Prize - described as the Oscars of grassroots environmentalism - as it presented an opportunity to tell the wider world about the situation in Cambodia.
""I hope the world will help us bring about change, and protect forests for future generations,"" he said.
""I will use this award to protect and defend the forests, and to ask local people and the international community to protect these areas.""
He added that he planned to use the prize money to help finance his work.
Mr Ouch and five other grassroots campaigners will receive their prize at a ceremony in San Francisco on Monday.
The other winners are:
Edward Loure from Tanzania: Mr Loure led a grassroots organisation that developed an approach to secure land titles to indigenous communities rather than individuals in order to protect the environment for future generations
Zuzana Caputova from Slovakia: Ms Caputova, a lawyer, led a campaign that resulted in the closure of a toxic waste dump that was having an adverse impact on the area's environment and community.
Luis Jorge Rivera Herrera from Puerto Rico: Mr Rivera Herrera's campaign led to the establishment a nature reserve at a location deemed to be an important nesting ground for the endangered leatherback turtle.
Destiny Watford from the United States: Ms Watford mobilised support in her Baltimore community to halt plans to build what would have been the nation's largest incinerator plant less than a mile from the high school where she was a student.
Maxima Acuna from Peru: Ms Acuna, a subsistence farmer, protected her right to continue living off her farmland despite a mining company's plans to develop a gold and copper mine on the site.

"It's not natural Labour territory. The party has lost every election here since 1950. At this year's general election, the Conservatives were returned with an 18,000 majority.
But the people of Chelmsford, in Essex, were queuing round the block outside the city's civic theatre to hear Jeremy Corbyn.
If this had been a football crowd, there would have been purveyors of hot pies. If it had been an audience waiting to the see the latest cinema blockbuster, there would be popcorn vendors.
But it's the 87th Corbyn rally of the Labour leadership campaign. So the products being paraded at the venue were food for thought - newspapers from parties and factions to the left, or on the left, of Labour - Socialist Worker, Socialist Appeal, Labour Briefing.
There were almost as many people here as there have been Corbyn rebellions against his own party leadership. So why were 500 giving up their evening to hear the veteran left winger?
""He's a breath of fresh air,"" says Helen Davenport, a teacher who had left the Labour party for the Greens. ""I gave up hope,"" she says. ""But now there's an alternative. I like his ideas on renationalising rail and he has a more sympathetic policy on immigration. He has the wisdom of Tony Benn.""
Sasha McLoughlin agrees: ""It's the first time a Labour leader has represented me in years. You vote Labour because that's what you do but it's so exciting to have a leftwing leader, not a Tory in disguise.""
Further up the line was Gerard Darcy. He says he wasn't a natural Corbyn supporter but found him to be ""straight-talking"".
He went on: ""There's no artifice. No spin. The other candidates are preened, moulded. He looks like a 70s sociology lecturer but people are now in to the issues, not the image - no one cares about what his smile looks like.""
He says Andy Burnham would be ""excellent"" but is now his second choice.
And the phenomenon that is Corbynmania continued inside the venue. In the media scrum that now surrounds him everywhere he goes, he was asked by Finnish television to give advice to their social democrats, and by Le Monde to comment on French President Francois Hollande's move to the right.
Incidentally, he responds that Hollande ""hasn't felt sufficiently able to challenge austerity"".
Not a criticism he would level at himself. So how has a left-winger who had languished on the backbenches  - someone to whom Ed Miliband's former chief of staff Lucy Powell admits to never having spoken - now become something of an international celebrity?
He seems quite bemused yet nonplussed by the attention. He needed the support of 35 Labour MPs to get on the ballot and he points out he only got enough nominations with just one minute fifteen seconds to the deadline. This was no long-standing left-wing conspiracy.
He had to ""max out"" his credit card to get the campaign started and while he has received donations from trade unions such as Unite and communications workers' union the CWU, he appeared to have caught an anti-austerity zeitgeist, with his targets for ""crowdfunding"" from individuals exceeded.
Irrespective of his politics, he does look and sound different from his Oxbridge educated opponents, all of whom were advisers to Labour politicians before becoming MPs.
He's a generation older, for a start. At 66, he was a Haringey councillor in the 70s and 80s before the other contenders even went to university.
""I have got very few qualifications,"" he tells me -  he dropped out of North London Polytechnic - ""but I have a fascination of reading and read a lot. I spent a lot of time in the school library and the local library and I have this view that everyone I meet knows something I don't know and we can learn from each other.""
He was weaned on socialist literature. Not for him the Famous Five: ""My mother gave me the Ragged Trousered Philanthropists to read."" This was Robert Tressell's novel of working class life in Mugsborough - or Hastings - before World War One, and the philanthropists of the title are the people who are all too willing to do back-breaking work for the benefit of their ""betters"".
His maths-teacher mother also gave him the diaries of George Orwell. He spent two years on voluntary service overseas in the Caribbean, but first became active in politics in Shropshire.
He founded the Wrekin Young Socialists - the youth wing of the Labour Party -  in the mid-60s. He was the organisation's secretary and regularly attracted 40 to 50 youthful activists to Sunday night meetings.
He produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War - perhaps the perfect pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition with CND stalwart Monsignor Bruce Kent in 2001 - though it's worth remembering that was initially a protest against intervention in Afghanistan, not Iraq.
He is not in principle against the deployment of British troops but cannot think of current circumstances where he would do so.
He first successfully fought his Islington North in seat in 1983, when the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally under Michael Foot's leadership on a platform of unilateral disarmament and withdrawal from the EU.
Labour had moved decisively to the left in London, too, but with more success. Ken Livingstone was at the head of the then Greater London Council, later abolished by Mrs Thatcher's government.
It had been literally a divisive time for his party, with some former cabinet ministers splitting away to form the SDP. Meanwhile some of those on the left tried to unseat MPs they regarded as too right-wing, but who hadn't jumped ship. Corbyn had backed Tony Benn's unsuccessful attempt to become the party's deputy leader - he was very narrowly defeated by Denis Healey.
So what had he learned from that period of division?
""It taught me in London we achieved a great deal - on transport, on the environment - but it also taught me the formation of the SDP was catastrophic to the electoral chances of Labour.
""The Conservative so-called triumph in 1983 owed more to the division of the opposition vote than a move to the left. But it also taught me that you have to take communities with you.""
There has been a lot of focus on Jeremy Corbyn's disloyalty to his own party. He rebelled on a quarter of all votes during the 2005-2010 government.
But I wondered why he had stayed loyal to Labour rather than moving to any of a myriad of parties to its Left when some of the policies he held dear - on nuclear weapons and re-nationalisation - had been ditched?
""I want to see a more equal, more just society and the Labour Party has always been the vehicle to achieve that, especially with its organic link to the trade unions. I have argued my case on lots of issues and I think things are changing.""
And this is his verdict on the 2015 election: ""One of the reasons we lost is we weren't offering anything sufficiently different.""
Well, you certainly couldn't accuse him of not wishing to put that right.
He tells an appreciative if not overly enthusiastic audience in Essex that the government's welfare bill ""is absolutely brutal"" and he will oppose the benefits cap.
The cost of welfare is so high, he says, in part because of high rents - which in turn are a symptom of not building enough affordable homes. He rebelled against his party's abstention on the welfare bill while Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, despite their doubts, stuck with collective shadow cabinet responsibility. They see that episode as the catalyst for Corbynmania.
He rails against tuition fees, but also opposes those in his party who want to see a graduate tax. He said that ""wise"" old Tony Benn had told him: ""you should tax people because they are wealthy, not because they are educated.""
And he defends his policy of using quantitative easing - whereby the Bank of England would increase the supply of money in the economy - to fund infrastructure projects. His critics say it would push up inflation and erode living standards.
He responds: ""If you said to people in Germany I have a radical new idea of a National Investment Bank they would just shrug their shoulders and say we are doing that already. What's extreme about that?""
And on challenging the agenda of austerity, he says his party has to be bold. The debt ridden government of 1945 - when, after a by-election, even Chelmsford briefly had a Labour MP - ""didn't retrench, it invested"".
There is a feeling, though, that if his campaign isn't running out of steam, he to some extent is - cramming in public meetings, rallies and media appearances.
""That's socialism,"" he says as he is handed, without asking, a glass of water mid-speech as his voice finally falters.
He finishes by denouncing the legacy of the Iraq War and promises ""whatever the result of the leadership election"" that the party's grass roots will be empowered.
Mandate for change
And he does go on to get a standing ovation.
But I ask him how he could be at the head of a shadow cabinet that disagrees with him on fundamental issues - such as the renewal of Trident - or indeed lead a party whose policies in some key respects are very different from his own?
""Whoever is elected leader will have a very large mandate from the members and the Parliamentary Labour Party - important as it is - I hope will recognise there is at the very least a mandate for a full debate within the party.""
Andy Burnham has said he would not be part of a shadow cabinet that didn't commit to renewing Trident. Jeremy Corbyn sees this as a matter of party democracy: ""I feel strongly about nuclear weapons. We have to have that debate fairly soon as the government might reach a decision in 2016.""
Possibly as soon a this month's Labour Party conference.
Jeremy Corbyn is the front-runner in the campaign but his critics will say that his leadership would be dominated by those internal debates within Labour that would leave little time - even with the best will in the world - to take the fight to the government.
But Corbyn insists ""there is a thirst for doing politics differently"". We will find out just how many people are drinking in his ideas a week from now.","In the third of a series of in-depth profiles of the four Labour leadership candidates, Iain Watson catches up with Jeremy Corbyn in Essex at the latest of his campaign rallies.",34156274
"Labour argues that Kettering General Hospital could lose services, but this has been rejected by the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.
In Parliament, David Cameron said Labour was not telling the truth.
The NHS has told the BBC the hospital will not be downgraded.
An NHS consultation has started into the organisation of five hospital and clinical commissioning groups, in Northamptonshire, Milton Keynes and Bedfordshire.
The hospitals included in the review are Kettering - which is used by people living in Corby - Northampton, Milton Keynes, Luton and Dunstable, and Bedford.
The review looks at the option of providing ""specialist centres for some services where this will improve quality"".
At Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP for North West Leicestershire Andrew Bridgen asked the prime minister about concerns that Labour was running a negative campaign over the future of Kettering hospital.
Mr Cameron said: ""Labour MP after Labour MP is trouping up to Corby and claiming this hospital is not safe and they know this is simply not true.
""This hospital is being invested in by this government, unlike the party opposite.""
On a visit to the constituency on Tuesday to support Labour candidate Andy Sawford, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ""You clearly can't believe a word the Tories say on the NHS.
""Here in Corby and East Northamptonshire, ministers have failed to provide all the details about plans to downgrade services at Kettering.
""Local people should be given all the facts.""
The United Kingdom Independence Party candidate Margot Parker said: ""I live in the constituency. I live next to a nurse. I speak to local people. We know there is no truth in this at all.
""It is political football of the worst kind. It is a shabby load of nonsense and scaremongering.""
Jill Hope, who is standing for the Lib Dems, has described the claims as ""totally irresponsible"", while Tory candidate Christine Emmett has said she has received assurances about the future of the hospital.
The by-election was sparked by the resignation in August of sitting Conservative MP Louise Mensch.
Mrs Mensch, who won the seat at the 2010 general election, announced she was standing down for family reasons.
A date has yet to be set, but the by-election will almost certainly be on 15 November to tie in with the police and crime commissioner elections.","The prime minister has entered a row between Corby by-election candidates over the future of a hospital, amid claims it could be downgraded in a healthcare review.",19981430
"Mr Haldane, added that any rate rise would ""increase unnecessarily the chances of the economy falling below critical velocity"".
He is considered to be the most cautious policy-maker when it comes to raising interest rates.
Interest rates have been at 0.5% since 2009 and the financial crisis.
The first increase is now expected in late 2016. Forecasts were put back after the Bank of England's last inflation report in which the Bank said the outlook for global growth had weakened.
In a speech to trade union body the TUC, Mr Haldane also indicated that the next rate move could equally be a cut rather than a rise.
""Now more than ever in the UK, policy needs to be poised to move off either foot depending on which way the data break,"" he said in his speech.
Mr Haldane said that because wage growth could be weaker than currently expected, inflation may undershoot the Bank's November predictions, when it estimated that inflation would rise above its 2% target in two years.
The Consumer Price Index currently stands at 0.1%.
""Against that backdrop, my view is that the case for raising interest rates is still some way from being made,"" Mr Haldane said.
""Whatever the reason, the economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway. That is an awkward, indeed risky, time to be contemplating take-off.
""Meanwhile, inflationary trends do not at present give me sufficient confidence that inflation will be back at target, even two years hence.""
Mr Haldane also had strong words on the UK's increasingly expensive housing market.
""The UK housing market is broken,"" he told the TUC meeting.
""There is a chronic and accumulated imbalance between demand and supply, and it is that which is sending skyward - and has sent skyward - house prices.""","The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, has warned that the UK's ""economic aircraft appears to be losing speed on the runway"".",34804332
"Negotiators for the two sides at peace talks in Cuba said they would ask the UN to send a 12-month mission to oversee any ceasefire.
The UN has yet to agree to the proposal. The two sides have been holding peace talks for three years.
Both sides say they hope to reach a final peace deal by March 2016.
The BBC's Colombia correspondent Natalio Cosoy says the mechanism would only start to work once a final deal is agreed.
However both sides have insisted the announcement is more than a mere formality, suggesting it should be read as a signal that a definite deal is close, our correspondent adds.
""We have decided to ask the UN Security Council to create (a mission) of unarmed observers for a period of 12 months,"" the two sides said in a joint statement at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana, on Tuesday.
They said the mission would guarantee that any ceasefire and disarmament would be genuine and permanent, reports say.
Humberto de la Calle, the government's lead negotiator, described the announcement as a ""transcendental"" moment.
He said it was an ""unequivocal demonstration of our desire to end confrontation"", according to the Associated Press.
The joint announcement in Havana is a clear indication that the Colombian peace process is moving towards its final phase.
Since the negotiations were launched in November 2012, the Farc has announced several unilateral ceasefires and urged the government to do the same.
But even though the government has scaled down military operations recently, it has refused to join the Farc in a bilateral ceasefire.
President Juan Manuel Santos has said repeatedly that the rebels must first agree to lay down their weapons and give up their armed struggle.
Government and negotiators have now invited the UN Security Council to join them as an honest, reliable broker and oversee the end of the conflict.
The two sides have invested too much politically to let more than three years of negotiations fail at such a late stage, when difficult issues such as justice for the victims have been dealt with.
The Farc and the Colombian government seem to be working together now towards a safe, smooth landing.
An estimated 220,000 people have been killed in the fighting between Farc and the Colombian military, which began in 1964. It is the longest-running armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere.
Since official peace talks started in Havana in November 2012, negotiators have reached agreement on key issues such as the political participation of the rebels, land rights, drug trafficking and transitional justice.
However it is unclear whether a final deal can be reached by the 23 March deadline set last year.
In September, President Juan Manuel Santos and Farc chief Timoleon Jimenez, known as Timochenko, said they wanted an agreement within six months.
But the Farc said last week that ""substantial hurdles"" were putting the deadline under threat.

"The RDG, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said it was the smallest annual rise for six years.
Regulated fares, which include season tickets, are capped at no more than July's RPI inflation rate of 1%.
Unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets, can go up by as much as the train companies like.
RDG chief Paul Plummer said: ""We know that nobody likes to pay more to travel by train, especially to get to work.""
But he added that money from fares now almost covers rail's daily operating costs.
""This allows government to focus its funding on building a bigger, better network when the railway is becoming increasingly important at driving economic growth, underpinning jobs, and connecting friends and families,"" Mr Plummer said.
Under government rules, the rise in regulated fares was restricted to no more than the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation over the year to July, which was 1%. Over the long term, RPI has tended to record higher inflation than the other measure of rising prices, the Consumer Price Index, which was 0.1% during the year.
The increases cover fares in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland is treated separately.
Martin Abrams, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said more must be done to achieve a ""truly affordable railway"" as fares have risen by more than 25% in the last five years.
""To avoid pricing people off the railways, the train operating companies and the government need to work closely together to provide fairer, simpler and cheaper fares through flexible ticketing and making sure people are always sold the cheapest ticket available.""
Mr Abrams insisted it was ""simply unfair"" that flexible ticketing has not yet been introduced, leading many part-time workers to ""fork out for five-day season tickets which don't give them the same savings that full-time commuters get"".
Rail Minister Claire Perry claimed the government's decision to link regulated fare increases to no more than RPI will save the average season ticket holder £425 by 2020.
She added: ""Our plan for passengers is improving journeys for everyone. It's transforming the tickets people buy, how much they pay for them, the trains they sit on, how quickly they arrive and the stations they arrive in.""
But Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said the rise was ""another kick in the teeth for the British passenger who is already paying some of the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped out and overcrowded trains"".
The increase would help ring-fence the profits of ""rip-off private rail companies who, once again, will be laughing all the way to the bank"".
Today's rise is the smallest since 2010 and even that was a one-off blip before an election.
Regulated fares have actually raced up by around 40% in the past decade, taking season tickets around the south east of England well into the £4,000-£5,000 mark.
The whole point of letting the government regulate half our fares was to protect customers from big hikes by the train companies. They picked out the kind of tickets where people don't have much choice but to go by train. Like commuting into big cities.
This is the third year now that fare rises have been limited to inflation and they'll be kept there for the rest of this parliament. But it comes after years of stinging rises.","Britain's rail passengers will see a 1.1% rise in average fares from 2 January, 2016, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has announced.",35003820

Janet McTeer and West co-star as ruthless former lovers Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont.
Artistic director Josie Rourke will helm Christopher Hampton's play.
Les Liaisons Dangereuses is based on the scandalous 1782 novel by Choderlos de Laclos, which told of sex, intrigue and betrayal amongst aristocrats in pre-revolutionary France.
Its first theatre production 30 years ago starred Alan Rickman, Juliet Stevenson and Lesley Manville and won both the Olivier and Evening Standard Awards for best play.
Hampton went on to win an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for the 1988 film version starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer.
""I have long wanted to direct Christopher Hampton's superb Les Liaisons Dangereuses,"" said Rourke, ""and the cast we have drawn together is a testament to the brilliance of his play.""
Along with his stage work, West has appeared in TV dramas The Wire, The Hour and The Affair, while McTeer was recently seen in acclaimed drama The Honourable Woman and The White Queen.
Other highlights at the 250-seat theatre this autumn include the first major London run of Abi Morgan's early play Splendour, which will star Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Fairley and Genevieve O'Reilly.
Morgan has since gone on to write films such as The Iron Lady, Shame and the forthcoming Suffragette.
Splendour tells the story of a photojournalist at the heart of a coup in an eastern European state and will be directed by associate director Robert Hastie.
""One of the things that most excites me about this season is the strong leading roles for women,"" said Rourke.
""It is a thrill to announce a season of work that features, in plays by living writers, women of the calibre and power of Zawe Ashton, Sinead Cusack, Michelle Dockery, Michelle Fairley, Genevieve O'Reilly and Janet McTeer, who returns to the Donmar and the London stage.""

"The system can involve withdrawal of medication, food and fluids.
It can offer a peaceful and dignified death but there have been problems with its implementation, the government-commissioned review is set to say.
Health officials said the review was expected to recommend the LCP should be phased out within six to 12 months.
The system was developed at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the city's Marie Curie hospice in the 1990s to provide a model of best practice in the care of dying patients.
It can mean an end to invasive tests, treatment or feeding through tubes that is deemed to cause unnecessary suffering at the end of life - but it should be discussed with the patient, family or carer where possible.
The pathway was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute.
It was intended to provide uniform, high-quality, dignified care for dying patients - whether they were in hospital, at home, in a care home or in a hospice.
Previously, there were concerns that care had been patchy, with some hospitals failing to meet acceptable standards, and accusations that people were subjected to invasive treatment and testing that offered no chance of preventing death, but merely prolonged their suffering.
Under the LCP, patients are regularly reviewed to ascertain whether medication should be stopped - and whether fluids should be withdrawn once they have ceased to be able to eat and drink.
However, families have complained relatives were put on the pathway without their consent, and that death has been hastened in people who were not dying imminently.
Critics say that it is impossible for doctors to predict when death is imminent, so the decision to put a patient on the pathway is at worst self-fulfilling.
There have also been suggestions that the pathway has been used to help hospitals save money. NHS Trusts do receive payouts for hitting targets related to its use - but the suggestion that the pathway has been used for cynical reasons has been vigorously denied by the Department of Health.
The Department of Health (DoH) in England set up an independent review amid fears the LCP was being used to hasten death, to clear beds and save money, and that patients or their families were not being consulted.
The review, led by crossbench peer Baroness Julia Neuberger, applies only to England. The LCP is also used in Scotland and Northern Ireland but not in Wales, which has its own framework for end-of-life care and support.
A Scottish Government spokeswoman told the BBC it welcomed the Neuberger review.
""Recommendations set out in the report will be considered by the Living and Dying Well National Advisory Group, so that any learning for Scotland can be taken forward with stakeholders,"" the spokeswoman said.
The review for England was asked to focus on the use of the LCP model rather than re-evaluating its basic merits.
But the DoH said the review team, which heard evidence from patients, families and health professionals, encountered ""numerous examples of poor implementation and worrying standards in care"".
The review was likely to conclude the LCP needed to be replaced, it said in a statement.
""The independent review into end of life care system the Liverpool Care Pathway, commissioned last year by Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb and backed by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is likely to recommend that the LCP is phased out over the next six to 12 months,"" the DoH said.
The statement gave no indication of what might replace the LCP.
But Mr Lamb said: ""We need a new system of better end-of-life care tailored to the needs of individual patients and involving their families.""
He ordered the review in November last year amid intense media scrutiny of the LCP following criticism from patients' families.
At the time, he said he was concerned about the ""unacceptable"" cases that had come to light.
British Medical Association president elect Baroness Finlay said the LCP was originally brought in because patients were ""dying badly, in hospitals in particular"".
They were being ""walked past, ignored and neglected"", she said, and the LCP was an attempt to ""roll out the best of hospice care into other areas"".
""By and large that worked well but the problem has been that it hasn't always been used properly,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
She said that if the LCP was phased out it was vital something better replaced it. ""Something which is very clear, very simple and which drives up professional behaviour,"" Baroness Finlay added.
Dr Linda Patterson, clinical vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians - which has been reviewing the LCP every year since it was introduced in 2004 - said the system was ""very helpful"".
""But if the execution of it in all instances has not been right then we need to review that,"" she added.
""All doctors dealing with patients who may unfortunately die need to be trained in end-of-life care. We need to know what the standards are, we need to be able to apply them, our junior doctors and trainees need to be fully trained in it. And we also need time - time to be able to discuss these very difficult issues.""
Jason Suckley, director of policy and campaigns at Sue Ryder, said the healthcare charity's research had shown the timing and quality of conversations health professionals had with terminally-ill patients amounted to a ""lottery"".
He said workers' communication skills needed to be improved and urged Health Education England, which provides training and support for healthcare professionals, to include end-of-life training in its workforce mandate.
""When it comes to dying we cannot afford to get it wrong and health professionals need to be supported to communicate with people effectively at a very traumatic and emotionally difficult time,"" he said.
The review's findings are due to be published in full on Monday.","The Liverpool Care Pathway, developed to support patients as they near death, should be phased out in England, an independent review is expected to say.",23283820
"Joyce Watson, Labour AM for Mid and West Wales, backs a fingerprint ID system of cashless payments to help poorer children.
She is due to launch a debate on the issue in the Senedd on Tuesday and says some pupils are going hungry to avoid being seen to claim free meals.
She says there is a mixed picture on the use of cashless payment systems.
Her office's research indicates that in Denbighshire, for example, all secondary schools use some sort of cashless system, whereas in Anglesey none do.
Most commonly, in schools where children still pay with cash for their dinners, pupils eligible for free meals are given tickets.
The AM believes this makes it easy for such children to be identified and put at risk of bullying.
She recommends rolling out a system by which children have accounts to pay for school dinners which can be topped up either by their parents or by the local authority if they qualify for school meals.
All pupils would then pay for their meals by a biometric reading of their fingerprint at the till without anyone knowing how their account was funded.
Ms Watson said: ""68% is the average take up of free school meals where we have a system that identifies against a near 100% where we have a system that doesn't identify those who have free school meals and those who don't.
She claimed that in schools without a cashless system there were ""an awful lot of children simply going hungry"" to avoid being seen to have free meals.
""[They] can't concentrate. Their sugar levels fall and their behaviour is also adversely affected by what's happening,"" she said.
Ms Watson intends to use her short debate during the assembly plenary to remind fellow AMs of a government commitment to roll out such cashless systems.
She said: ""[Education Minister Leighton Andrews] did commit to rolling this out by September 2012.
""I want to know that that is happening. And I really think that this archaic practice of identifying children has to stop.""
Addressing security concerns, Ms Watson said pupils' fingerprints were stored securely by the company that installed the biometric technology away from the school and could not be accessed by authorities.
One disincentive to move to a biometric system may be the cost, which the AM estimates at up to Â£30,000 for installation and Â£2,000 a year for maintenance.
However, Stephen Jones, head teacher of Ysgol Glan-y-Mor in Burry Port, Carmarthenshire, said its piloting of a biometric payment system over the last four years had delivered results.
He said it had cut the time pupils queued for lunches as well as removing any stigma attached to free school meals.
""The children like it,"" he said.
""It's almost a fun element to having their lunch, the fingerprints.
""It's much quicker so they're happy about that.

The home side finished on 151-7 in reply to Glamorgan's 176-5, despite Michael Klinger's 52 off 34 balls.
Miller struck his 50 off 33 including three sixes, as the Welsh County moved to the top of the south group table.
Rudolph's 51 off 46 was a more measured effort, while Sri Lankan seamer Thisara Perera bowled tightly for his 2-25.
Glamorgan moved ahead of Surrey on net run-rate at the top as Miller showed his international class despite a patchy wicket which benefitted the medium-pacers.
Klinger threatened for a while to get Gloucestershire in the chase in front of a packed home crowd, but Colin Ingram took 1-18 in a mean four overs while Graham Wagg claimed his 100th T20 wicket and the home side fell short.
Man of the match David Miller told BBC Wales Sport:
""I'm very happy to be one (win) from one, and looking forward to the next four games. I was a bit nervous for a couple of balls, it took me six or seven to get going but it's nice batting with Jacques Rudolph who has a lot of experience.
""It's always good to hit the pavilion, the one I got out I was trying to hit over the top of the apartments, but it's nice to hit a few sixes and get the run-rate up.
""Every single game I get nervous, but it's what you do with the nerves and where you take it - it's a short stint to make an impression but I'm just trying to play my game and enjoy it, which has been really easy with this changing-room.""",Fifties for Glamorgan debutant David Miller and captain Jacques Rudolph proved key as they beat Gloucestershire by 25 runs in Bristol.,40709964

"Female officers will be able to wear a headscarf under their caps or berets, provided it is plain and is the same colour as the uniform.
Headscarf bans on university campuses and state institutions - except for the judiciary, military and police - have also been lifted in recent years.
The garment has been controversial in Turkey for years. Secularists regard it as a symbol of religious conservatism.
Since the 1920s, Turkey has had a secular constitution with no state religion.
The opposition have accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) of trying to reinterpret secularism.
However, public debate has also evolved to accept the hijab as an expression of individual liberties, correspondents say.
No strong opposition has been voiced against this latest move.
President Erdogan has long embraced Turks' right to express their religious beliefs openly, but he says he is committed to secularism.
In 2010, the country's universities abandoned an official ban on Muslim headscarves.
Three years later, women were allowed to wear headscarves in state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. That year, four MPs wore headscarves in parliament.

"But the Frenchman's situation remains ""challenging"" and the 25-year-old is in a critical but stable condition.
Earlier, Bianchi's father Philippe had described the situation as ""desperate"".
""Every time the telephone goes, we know it could be the hospital to tell us that Jules is dead,"" he said.
""He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it.""
He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: ""I speak to him. I know he can hear me.
""His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up.
""His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules.""
Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules.
""I've never seen anything like that,"" Philippe said. ""It touched us very deeply. We thank every one of them. So many of them have been in touch, written to me; [Fernando] Alonso, [Jean-Eric] Vergne, [Felipe] Massa have given strong messages.
""[Lewis] Hamilton wrote me a beautiful email in which he says that if there is anything he can do, he's there. [Valentino] Rossi and [Marc] Marquez from Moto GP too.""
Philippe also said he is using the accident of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who continues his recovery at home after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident in December, as a reference point.
""I was very sad when he got hurt,"" Philippe said. ""I kept wondering, like every one else 'Why don't they tell us more about how he is?'.
""But now I'm in the same position I understand. Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable.
""One day he seems a bit better, other days a bit worse. The doctors don't say. The damage from the accident is very bad but we don't know how it will evolve.
""Even with Schumacher it took months to come out of the coma. [FIA president] Jean Todt said he hopes Michael will one day be able to have a normal life. One day I hope we can say the same about Jules.""
He added: ""It's tough. In a week the life of this family has been destroyed. What are we doing here? Living a nightmare in a place very far from home.
""But when Jules gets a bit better we can transfer him, maybe to Tokyo and things will be a bit easier. But who knows when that will happen. If it will happen.

"New City manager Pep Guardiola is keen to make Stones his next high-profile transfer of the summer.
Stones was one of only two outfield players not to see action in England's disappointing Euro 2016 campaign.
Talks have yet to take place, but the asking price would make Stones, 22, Britain's most expensive defender.
Everton have no need to sell, but the possibility is growing that Stones will leave before the start of the new Premier League season.
He was at the centre of a transfer battle last summer when Everton rejected a succession of bids rising up to almost £40m from Chelsea, simply refusing to sell to then manager Jose Mourinho.
Guardiola has made Stones, who has 10 England caps, a priority target as he prepares to renew his rivalry with Mourinho, who is now across the city at Manchester United, and looks certain to get his man.
Manchester City have already signed Ilkay Gundogan from Borussia Dortmund and completed a £13.8m deal for Spain forward Nolito from Celta Vigo after their interest in Euro 2016 was ended by Italy.
Everton will give any money they get for Stones to new manager Ronald Koeman to increase his already considerable transfer fund.

He said: ""Until the fixture programme is published, we don't know when it will be or who the opposition is likely to be. But because we have got the best lights in the country for cricket purposes, then it's likely that we would be one of the selected grounds to host such an event.

"The ex-chief executives, who previously ran Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons, M&S and B&Q, said a drop in the pound coupled with supply chain disruption would cause prices to spike.
The average household could be £580 a year worse off as a result, retail union USDAW has predicted.
Vote Leave rejected the claims.
""Independent experts are clear, EU membership and the meddling court that comes with it have put up prices and hurt our economic growth,"" said Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott.
""The EU is costly, bureaucratic and blind to the impact it has had on people's wages and soaring energy bills.""
But the retail bosses, which include former Marks and Spencer boss Marc Bolland and former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King, insisted that a UK exit from the European Union would be ""catastrophic for millions of ordinary families"".
USDAW said it had calculated its £580 figure based on an expected fall in sterling in the event of the UK's exit from the EU, together with expected new tariffs imposed on imported EU goods including food, drink and clothing.
The former bosses of Tesco, M&S, Sainsbury's and B&Q already warned last month that prices would rise amid a so-called Brexit, but their ranks have swelled with the addition of the ex-chief executives of Asda and Morrisons.
Richard Lloyd, former executive director of consumer group Which?, said he was now ""convinced that leaving the EU will give ordinary British families a worse deal for years to come"".
""My advice to consumers is clear - this could be an expensive mistake, don't risk it,"" he said.
Tough competition from discount rivals together with low inflation means that overall the prices of groceries has steadily fallen.

"After two rain-hit days, Derbyshire added 75 runs to be bowled out for 275, visiting skipper Joe Leach taking 4-50.
Former captain Mitchell then made 120, followed by 150 from D'Oliveira to help Worcestershire close on 323-3.
That is a lead of 48 - and quick runs on day four could set up a victory.
Mitchell, who had starred on this ground on Tuesday night to help Worcestershire book a One-Day cup semi-final, passed the landmark of 10,000 first-class runs for the county when he had reached 87.
Earlier, Derbyshire had held up Worcestershire for 20 overs in the morning session to earn a second batting point.
That was largely due to a ninth-wicket stand of 45 between Tony Palladino (32) and Tom Taylor, who was caught behind to give Ed Barnard the first of two late victims and Ben Cox his 200th first-class catch.
When Worcestershire batted, Mitchell was first to reach his ton, just before tea, while D'Oliveira's was his first since his career-best double century against Glamorgan last May when he began the season with three tons in four games.
Derbyshire skipper Billy Godleman told BBC Radio Derby:
""The wicket definitely played slightly differently when they batted. There was less in it for our bowlers.
""We were disappointed with how we bowled with the new ball, although both openers played well.
""I imagine they will come out and play a few shots and then we will have an opportunity and challenge against their bowlers in the second innings but we will fight as hard as we can.""
Worcestershire opener Brett D'Oliveira told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
""I'm really pleased for Mitch. It's been quite tough for us early season against the new ball on tasty pitches and for him to pass 10,000 runs is a hell of an achievement. He played a fantastic knock and helped me a lot.
""We are in a great position. We will try and kick on early and put them under pressure with the bat.
""We bat all the way down, which is a real strength for us so, if we can push on in the morning, the quicker we can get them in again.""",Worcestershire's Brett D'Oliveira made his first hundred in over a year as he shared a 243-run opening stand with fellow centurion Daryl Mitchell against Derbyshire on day three at Derby.,39988907
"Georg Niedermeier's own goal gave Pep Guardiola's side a half-time lead, which David Alaba doubled.
Daniel Didavi fired into the top corner for Stuttgart, but Douglas Costa's long-range shot sealed Bayern's win.
Borussia Dortmund, in second, can cut the gap to five points with a win at Schalke on Sunday.
Bayern need a maximum of 11 points from their final five league matches to secure the title for Guardiola before he leaves to join Manchester City at the end of the season.
The Bayern boss rotated his squad with Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg trip to Benfica in mind, beginning with Thomas Muller, Philipp Lahm, Costa and Thiago on the bench.
But he brought on Muller after just 27 minutes, concerned that Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal was in danger of getting sent off after making two reckless challenges and collecting an early booking.
Stuttgart captain Niedermeier scored at the wrong end as he stretched to prevent Franck Ribery's cross reaching Robert Lewandowski.
Austria international Alaba added another early in the second half, showing neat footwork before beating goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton at the near post.
Didavi, Stuttgart's leading scorer, improvised superbly to pull a goal back with just under half-an-hour left as he hooked the ball past Manuel Neuer while on the ground for his 11th of the season, but Costa's 25-yard drive ended hopes of a comeback.

"The Nevada State Athletic Commission (NAC) confirmed a one-off rule change to drop the glove size from 10oz.
""I don't believe with the new gloves he makes it out of the second round,"" said UFC champion McGregor, 29.
""Part of me kind of wants to show some skill and dismantle him but I do not see him absorbing the blows.""
""I am ready to go to war for 12 rounds and I am also ready to put him away in seconds,"" he added. ""There is no way in hell I am not prepared to fight in the deepest of trenches.""
The move to allow lighter gloves came as a surprise as the 154lbs bout is considerably over the 147lbs limit at which 8oz gloves can be used. The lighter gloves have less padding over the knuckles and are believed to favour the heavier puncher.
Earlier in August, the NAC, who sanctioned the contest, told BBC Sport they could not recall a fight at 154lbs ever being given dispensation to make such a move.
McGregor typically uses 4oz fingerless gloves in MMA, while undefeated boxer Mayweather has used 8oz gloves in 46 of his 49 bouts.
In a lengthy conference call, McGregor took questions from journalists around the world just 10 days before he makes his boxing debut in Las Vegas against former five-weight world champion Mayweather, 40.
He revealed he has been conducting ""scary"" training sessions at 13,000ft in an altitude chamber and stated he feels in ""absolutely amazing"" condition for the T-Mobile Arena bout.
But the UFC lightweight champion believes he has been ""discarded"" by boxing analysts and made to feel ""not welcome"" in the build-up to what could be the richest fight in history.
""It's certainly motivating - the disrespect and disregard for my skillset,"" added McGregor. ""I look at people sometimes and their mind is closed.
""Fighting is a complex game. I use it as motivation and I look forward to going in and educating the world on what martial arts is.""
McGregor's future beyond his boxing debut has been queried by MMA fans who fear he may not be motivated to return to UFC after earning a reported $100m in facing Mayweather.
He addressed several potential career avenues during the conference call and contests he is still a current multiple-weight UFC champion despite vacating his featherweight belt in November.
""The current featherweight champion is Max Holloway, a man I dismantled,"" added McGregor.
""Everyone knows, I am the multiple world champion. I look forward to going back and continuing where I left off.""
McGregor said Mayweather would get his ""respect"" if he followed through on comments made on a US talk show this week in which he said the pair could rematch under MMA rules.
Paulie Malignaggi - who quit as McGregor's sparring partner after reacting angrily to images appearing to show him knocked down in a session - has also raised the prospect of coming out of retirement to box the Irishman.
""Tell him to shut his mouth and join the queue,"" McGregor said when asked about facing the former two-weight world champion.

Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Taylor remains unbeaten as a professional, having outclassed Alfonso Olvera in Las Vegas in January.
""I feel as if I need a little bit more experience at the level I'm at just now, get more rounds under my belt and be involved in a few good, testing fights before I get that chance to have a world title fight,"" Taylor told BBC Scotland.
""It's just a matter of being patient and developing as an athlete. I'd fight against any super-lightweight in the world but I don't want to rush, I want to develop and gain more experience so when that chance comes I'm ready for it.
""I don't want to jump into fighting for world titles when I don't feel as if I've had enough experience. The rate I'm going at now is perfect.""
And while he says when the time comes he will happily fight WBA super-lightweight champion Burns anywhere, Taylor does have an ideal venue in mind.
""It would sell out anywhere but the dream would be Edinburgh Castle,"" added Taylor.

"But why has this always been such a struggle? You could build a paper mountain out of all the plans to give vocational education the same status as university degrees, A-levels and GCSEs.
""It's a deeply cultural thing,"" says Sir Vince, who held office during the Coalition government.
""It got built into the British mindset... if you're clever, you go to university, and if you're not so clever you go off and do a trade of some sort,"" he says.
""It's still the case that if you're academically inclined and you don't know what to do, you go to university.
""The others are told, 'Why not do an apprenticeship?' without being given much of a steer as to how to do it.
""And that's completely wrong, for many people it would be better if they went down that route from day one.""
Sir Vince, who once taught Open University economics courses, is now getting back to his own educational roots.
He is leading an online course on economics and politics, with the University of Nottingham, which will be available free on the Futurelearn online university network set up by the Open University.
There will be no shortage of contemporary upheavals for these online students to talk about.
Sir Vince talks of a ""bizarre Alice in Wonderland world"" in which the Chinese Communists are now the advocates of free trade while the United States, under President Donald Trump, is raising the banner of protectionism.
""You've got a hard-line Communist out there defending the liberal international economic order,"" he says.
He describes himself as a ""big fan of the Chinese"", adding: ""like George Osborne"".
Sir Vince had a close-up view of economic decision-making by politicians.
He ranks Gordon Brown above David Cameron or Tony Blair on their grasp of economics - and says that all politicians can be guilty of looking for economic theories that confirm their political inclinations.
George Osborne's approach to cutting the deficit, in the wake of the financial crash of 2008, was shaped by the rules set by US economist Kenneth Rogoff, says Sir Vince.
And he says that the current rise of nationalism, populism and the push for protectionism are the direct fallout from the economic hangover from the recession.
""The real energy behind this new populism does come from 2008,"" he says.
""Real wages have declined, particularly in deprived parts of the country, public spending has been cut because of the deficit.""
He says this has delivered a shock to a political system built on a post-War assumption of rising living standards.
Sir Vince's new teaching project forms part of the wave of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses.
Moocs are also characterised by being free - and his period in office as business secretary saw him taking the controversial decision to raise university tuition fees in England to Â£9,000 per year.
Tuition fees have hung like a dark cloud over the Liberal Democrats ever since - but he remains a stout defender of the fee increase.
""It was the right thing to do, but very, very politically painful,"" he says.
The alternative was to cut the further education budget. ""I wasn't willing to go along with that.""
The fees are in effect a graduate tax, rather than a fee, he says, and the Liberal Democrats' big mistake was signing a pledge not to increase fees.
He says he was ""vehemently opposed"" to this promise before the 2010 election.
""I could see that if ever we got into government, it would be a disaster.
""But there was a very strong head of steam and the leader felt he had to go along with it, and once we were in government we were inevitably exposed.""

"In a study of more than 70,000 women, optimists were less likely to get fatal cancer, heart disease, lung conditions and stroke in their retirement years.
Although some of the association is explained by healthier life choices and behaviours, experts believe a positive mental attitude is powerful in itself.
And even if you lack a natural sunny disposition, optimism can be learned.
Encouraging people to imagine a bright future could be a good medicine to boost public health, say the authors of the study in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
The researchers looked at health data collected from a large US study of working and retired female nurses.
The participants had been asked to rate how optimistic they perceived themselves to be on a scale of zero to 24.
The healthy women, who ranged in age from 58 to 83, were monitored over the next eight years and any disease-related deaths were recorded. There were 4,566 deaths overall.
Higher optimism was linked with lower death risk, even after controlling for other factors such as whether the woman was married, came from a richer or poorer family background, or had a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or depression.
A significantly lowered risk was seen for deaths from a number of causes, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, respiratory disease and infection over the course of the study period.
The researchers believe optimism may have a biological effect on the body as well as a psychological one, although they didn't look at this.
Other studies have linked a positive outlook to lower inflammation, for example, and better heart health.

"A new report from the Centre for Cities and the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, said all cities would see a fall in output due to increasing trade costs.
Aberdeen and Edinburgh were both ranked among the ten most affected cities.
However the study said both cities are also among the best-placed to respond to any predicted economic turbulence.
The study excludes Belfast as the authors said data for Northern Ireland was not available.
The UK government said it was committed to securing a ""bold and ambitious"" free trade deal and building on the diverse strengths of all the UK's cities and regions.
Meanwhile, Scottish and Welsh government ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss Brexit legislation.
Earlier in July, business advisers PwC said uncertainty about Brexit was having a negative impact on the Scottish economy and housing market.
The London-based Centre for Cities think-tank said all UK cities faced ""significant economic challenges"" as the UK leaves the EU due to a predicted increase in trading costs.
They produced predicted reductions in economic output for each of the country's cities, for both the scenario of a so-called ""soft"" Brexit - with the UK joining a free trade area such as the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) - or a ""hard"" Brexit, where the UK does not come to an immediate deal with the EU and defaults to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.
The researchers said either scenario would result in an increase in non-tariff barriers, such as customs checks, border controls, differences in product market regulations and legal hurdles, all increasing the cost of trade.
Under both models, the group predicted that local trade flows and employment shares meant Aberdeen would see the largest reduction in output, measured by gross value added, over the next ten years - of 3.7% under the ""hard"" Brexit scenario, or of 2.1% under a ""soft"" Brexit.
Edinburgh was ranked sixth in the table in both models, with reductions of 2.7% and 1.4% respectively. Other cities which feature on the tables include London, Reading, Leeds and Swindon.
However, the researchers said the factors which made the cities likely to suffer in the short term also made them well-placed to respond.
They said the cities were ""home to large, highly-skilled labour markets, significant numbers of innovative firms and strong business networks - all of which are crucial in enabling a city to reinvent or adapt its industrial structure to changing economic circumstances"".
Prof Stephen Machin from the Centre for Economic Performance said: ""The fact that the industrial specialisation and the skill and knowledge intensity of different places are key to local impact should be of significant importance to the design and implementation of policy, especially in the arenas of industrial, skills and labour market strategies.""
A UK government spokesman said: ""We are committed to a bold and ambitious free trade agreement that works for the whole of the UK.
""The government is engaging extensively with businesses and organisations across the country, and will continue this work throughout the exit process.
""Through the government's modern industrial strategy we will look to build on the diverse strengths of all of the UK's cities and regions.""
Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie contended that Brexit would have a ""significant negative impact"" regardless of the deal secured, saying the government ""cannot just wave these numbers away"".
He said: ""People last year did not vote to make themselves poorer. The question on the ballot paper was not whether we wanted to destroy our economy and the prosperity of our cities. Giving the people a chance to exit from Brexit with a vote on the deal is the right and democratic thing to do.""
Scottish Labour said the report showed the importance protecting jobs and the economy as part of the Brexit deal.
Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said: ""There should be a jobs-first Brexit, to ensure that our cities such as Aberdeen and Edinburgh can continue to grow. Jobs, the economy and retaining the benefits of the single market and the customs union are our top priority.""
Meanwhile, Scottish and Welsh ministers have met in Cardiff to discuss the EU Withdrawal Bill, the legislation planned by the UK government to begin extricating the country from Europe's legal framework.
Scottish Brexit minister Mike Russell and Lord Advocate James Wolffe sat down with Welsh Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford and Welsh government's top lawyer, Counsel General Mick Antoniw.
The devolved administrations fear the legislation could see them lose powers over areas such as fishing and agriculture. The UK government denies this, and says the legislatures will actually gain powers as a result of Brexit.","Aberdeen could be the city worst hit by falling economic output due to a ""hard"" Brexit, experts have predicted.",40734848
"Camilla bought a box of mangoes with a Brixton Â£10 note, introduced last year to try to keep the money of local people within the community.
The couple were surrounded by shoppers as they walked along Electric Avenue.
They came to Brixton to see work which has started to revitalise the borough.
It was Charles' first visit to the area since 1996, when he was accompanied by the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
Greengrocer Derek Chong, who has run a stall on Electric Avenue for 20 years, said Camilla had been ""nice and pleasant"" when she purchased the fruit.
""She asked me what was nice, what would I recommend, and I said we've got some nice mangoes.

England lost their last Twenty20 series 2-1 to India in February.
Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June.
This will allow them to gain experience of playing with the pink Dukes balls that will be used for the first day-night Test to be played in England, against West Indies at Edgbaston in August.
Sussex fast bowler Tymal Mills, meanwhile, has been ruled out with a back injury, but Durham seamer Mark Wood returns after missing the India series through injury.
Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March.
Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire.
Jason Roy, who has managed just 18 runs in three innings for England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, is named in the squad.
Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: ""The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition.

"Ryan Thomas McManus, 31, from Ava Street in Belfast and Ryan Milligan, 29, from Manse Road in Dundrum were given seven-year terms for over 40 drugs offences.
They will serve half their terms in prison and half on licence.
A third man on charges died on Tuesday.
Connor Devenney, 36, from Dunwellan Park in Newcastle, County Down, appeared in court last week, when the Crown set out its case against the three men.
However, a judge was told that Devenney, who faced two charges linked to the operation, died on Tuesday night.
Passing sentence on McManus and Milligan, the judge said the pair were involved in a ""widespread supply of a quantity of illicit drugs"" that they distributed ""both in the UK and elsewhere"".
He said that on one level there was a degree of sophistication, due to the use of the internet and Bitcoin currency, but on another there was a lack of sophistication as they left a ""forensic trail"".
He said this trail allowed both the police and other authorities to ""become aware of the criminal activity"" that ultimately led to their arrest.
Last week, the court heard that Milligan and McManus were arrested on 5 August, 2013, when several properties they were linked to were searched and drugs were seized.
A crown prosecutor said that during the period of offending - which spanned from January 2012 to August 2013 - the pair received consignments of drugs that were delivered to addresses either occupied or controlled by them.
They also used a virtual mailbox facility in the centre of Belfast.

"After intervention from the Chinese ambassador, it is also now the litmus test for Anglo-China relations under the new regime at Number 10.
After EDF's board narrowly agreed to press ahead with the project, the UK government surprised company officials by saying it needed several weeks to consider before signing.
The decision to delay is widely thought to have come from Theresa May herself, influenced by Joint Chief of Staff and outspoken critic of China's creeping influence, Nick Timothy.
Without China's involvement, this project would not have received EDF board approval.
It was seen as a risk sharing mechanism for the French, a prestige project for China and the ushering in of ever-closer Chinese relations.
Nevertheless, and perhaps understandably, the prime minister wanted time to think.
Well, today's warning from the Chinese ambassador that the relationship between the two countries is at risk has given her plenty to think about.
Writing in the Financial Times, Liu Xiaoming made clear that the stakes here are high by linking government approval for Hinkley Point to the future of the relationship which is he said a ""crucial historical juncture"".
No kidding. In a post Brexit world, Britain needs all the friends it can get and much was made of the importance of forging close trade links with non-EU nations.
There may be legitimate security concerns over having sensitive infrastructure assets under Chinese management but a decision to back out will clearly take the shine off the ""golden era"" of collaboration between the two countries, proclaimed during Xi Jinping's state visit last year.
Theresa May is not the only one who wants to take her time. The French Journal du Dimanche quoted an unnamed EDF manager pointing out the benefits of hitting the pause button.
If construction was delayed until 2019 when a similar reactor will be up and running (fingers crossed) at Flamanville in France, the cost of financing the project would fall dramatically.
With a working example, EDF could secure cheaper loans with government guarantees rather than self finance through costly equity.
That would reduce the threat to EDF's finances, appease the French unions and lower the guaranteed price of the electricity produced from £92.50 to £75 per megawatt hour - a big saving for UK taxpayers.
It would however delay the project another three years at a time when infrastructure spending is seen as crucial to create jobs, stimulate the economy and keep the lights on.

They were found guilty of breaches surrounding a £1.3m ($2m) ""disloyal payment"" made to Platini in 2011.
The Fifa ethics committee found Blatter and Platini had demonstrated an ""abusive execution"" of their positions.
""I will fight for me and for Fifa,"" Blatter, 79, said at a news conference.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Platini said the decision was a ""masquerade"" intended to ""dirty"" his name.
Both men continue to deny wrongdoing and intend to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).
Swiss Blatter and 60-year-old Frenchman Platini have also been fined £33,700 ($50,000) and £54,000 ($80,000) respectively.
Despite the ban, both Blatter and Platini will be allowed to attend matches - including Euro 2016 in France - if they buy tickets in a private capacity.
Fifa boss since 1998, Blatter had already announced he was quitting with a presidential election in February.
Platini was tipped as a future leader of football's world governing body and is a three-time European Footballer of the Year.
He is also a former captain of France and has been in charge of Uefa - European football's governing body - since 2007.
Unshaven and sporting a plaster over his right cheek, Blatter was in defiant mood at a news conference he had called in advance of the punishments being made public.
""I will fight,"" he said. ""I will fight for me and for Fifa.""
He said he was ""really sorry"" that he is still ""a punching ball"" and that he has become tainted in the eyes of humanity.
He added that he thought he had convinced the Fifa ethics tribunal that the payment from Fifa to Platini was legitimate.
He plans to appeal, first to Fifa, then Cas. He may also take legal action under Swiss law if needed.
Blatter: Key quotes from hour-long news conference
""The decision is no surprise to me,"" he said in a statement. ""The procedure initiated against me by Fifa's ethics committee is a pure masquerade.
""It has been rigged to tarnish my name by bodies I know well and who for me are bereft of all credibility or legitimacy.""
In the meantime, Uefa has issued a statement, revealing it is ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision.
It added: ""Once again, Uefa supports Michel Platini's right to a due process and the opportunity to clear his name.""
Former Asian Football Confederation general secretary Peter Velappan added: ""This is very harsh, especially for Blatter because he dedicated his life to football and Fifa. Eight years is like a death sentence.""

Isha Johansen, the president of Sierra Leone's Football Association, said: ""I'm not saying Blatter was a saint, but the way everything has been piled on his head to make it look like it was all his fault... I think it's most unfair.""
French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet added: ""Michel Platini's suspension is shocking and saddens me. It seems unbelievable.
""But it does not surprise me as the ethics commission president had already announced that Michel would be suspended for several years. Michel's guilt was decided in advance.""
Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and Fifa reform campaigner Damian Collins believe it is the end for Blatter and Platini.
Dyke told BBC Radio 5 live he had ""no sympathy"" for Blatter but that the FA ""didn't know about Platini"" and ""were clearly disappointed"".
""We thought he had done a very good job as president of Uefa,"" he added.
British MP Collins said: ""The fish rots from the head down and we know how rotten the head of Fifa was.""
Former FA chairman David Bernstein told BBC Radio 5 live Blatter was ""a drowning man really, there's no coming back from this"".
""He'll fight, I'm sure of that. He's not a soft touch. He will fight but he is doomed. He is yesterday's man.""

Blatter and Platini were found guilty of ethics code breaches over the ""disloyal payment"".
Both claimed the payment was honouring an agreement made in 1998 for work carried out between 1998 and 2002 when Platini worked as a technical adviser for Blatter.
The payment was not part of Platini's written contract but the pair insisted it was a verbal agreement, which is legal under Swiss law.
German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of Fifa's adjudicatory chamber, held disciplinary hearings for the pair last week.
Charges included conflict of interest, false accounting and non co-operation, with investigators submitting a file of more than 50 pages.
World football's governing body has been in turmoil for several months, following numerous allegations of corruption.
Seven Fifa officials were arrested at a Zurich hotel at the end of May.
And US authorities have charged 39 football officials and sports business executives over more than £134m ($200m) in bribes for football television and marketing deals.
Swiss prosecutors are also investigating Fifa's management as well as the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar.
There is also pressure from governments and the International Olympic Committee for Fifa to push through major reforms aiming at making governance more transparent and accountable.
The presidential election is due to take place on 26 February.
There are currently five candidates to take over:
Voting will take place by secret ballot, with all Fifa's 209 member states having a vote each.
BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway: ""You've got this Shakespearean drama between Platini and Blatter - two men who were once the best of friends but have become the best of enemies.
""They have now effectively destroyed each other and their chances. Platini was at one point the favourite to become Fifa president but those hopes lie in tatters.
""Fifa wants to move on and try to re-establish its reputation, it's going to be difficult do that with Blatter and Platini continuing to make noise in the background.""
Joseph 'Sepp' Blatter was born in the alpine town of Visp in 1936. Blatter has been married three times and has one daughter.
After finishing school, he did his obligatory service in the Swiss army, rising to the rank of colonel.
He did not play football professionally but worked in the watch industry, then as a sports writer and in sports management, serving at the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation.
Blatter moved to Fifa as its technical director in 1975, before working as the general secretary from 1981.
He was elected, to much fanfare in his homeland, as the eighth Fifa president in 1998, succeeding Dr Joao Havelange.
He has split opinion with his sometimes controversial statements about the game but remains hugely popular with countries in Asia and Africa.
In 2004, he said female footballers should wear skimpier kits to increase the game's popularity and, following the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, said gay fans going to the Gulf state, where homosexuality is illegal, should ""refrain from sexual activity"".
Platini has been boss of European football's governing body since 2007 but rose to fame as one of France's greatest footballers.
The son of a former professional player, he played for Nancy and St Etienne before joining Italian giants Juventus, with whom he was named European Footballer of the Year on three occasions.
A midfielder, Platini also made 72 appearances for France, captaining them to victory at the 1984 European Championship and helping them reach the semi-finals of two World Cups, in 1982 and 1986.
He retired as player at 32, turning to coaching and managed the French national team with mixed results from 1988 to 1992.
After turning down an offer to coach Spanish giants Real Madrid, he was asked by French president Francois Mitterrand to organise the 1998 World Cup in France and, shortly after, was appointed vice-president of the French Football Federation.
Since 2002, Platini has been a member of the executive committee of Fifa and was elected president of Uefa in 2007. He was re-elected and also became Fifa vice-president.

This is 17% higher than the number made homeless in the year 2011-12.

But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was ""determined"" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win.
Referring to the ""diverse"" crowds of tens of thousands of people who have attended his leadership rallies in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said they showed ""there is an interest in politics... that then becomes surely a very strong campaigning base for the Labour movement"".
He added: ""I think you'll see it begin to play out, particularly in the local elections next year and after that.""
In June, 20 members of the shadow cabinet resigned, and one was sacked, over differences with Mr Corbyn.
Five told the BBC on Sunday they would return if asked by Mr Corbyn should he be re-elected, while nine others said they would stand if shadow cabinet elections were revived.
Mr Corbyn told Today he would ""reach out to"" Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership ""as I've reached out to them in the past"".
He said: ""I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we've been elected as Labour MPs...
""It doesn't mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party.""
On Tuesday, Labour's national executive committee meets and will consider a plan put forward by deputy leader Tom Watson to allow the parliamentary party - its MPs and peers currently serving in Westminster - to elect the shadow cabinet, as part of efforts to reunite the party as a whole.
At the moment they are appointed by the leader.
Newspaper reports suggested that, under the new plan, a third of Labour's top team could be elected by the parliamentary party, another third by the party membership, and the final third chosen by the leader.
Mr Corbyn has not given his support to the proposal but has indicated he would back members having a say.","Jeremy Corbyn has said he will ""reach out"" to Labour MPs if he is re-elected as the party's leader this week.",37404211
"The British Embassy in Rabat said Roger and Mathilde Lamb from Pensham, near Pershore, died in separate falls.
A spokeswoman said Mrs Lamb fell from a window of an apartment in the resort of Essaouira while Mr Lamb fell downstairs at a different building a few days later. They both died in hospital.
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman said the exact circumstances of the deaths were being investigated.
The FCO is providing consular assistance to the family.
In a statement, the couple's families said they were ""deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths"".
The couple, who have four sons aged between 11 and 17, were staying in the Moroccan resort of Essaouira.
Mrs Lamb's brother-in-law, Mark Rogerson, said the children were back in the UK being looked after by relatives.
He said they knew very few details about what happened, but were aware of Mrs Lamb's death last Thursday and then heard about her husband's death on Monday.
""We heard first of all that he was badly injured. And then on Monday we heard that he had died,"" he said.
Mr Lamb, who was an engineer and a graduate of the University of Birmingham, was working in Christchurch, New Zealand, while his family remained at home in Worcestershire.
The families said their main concern was for the couple's children.
""Roger and Tilly's families have been deeply shocked and saddened by their tragic deaths while on holiday in Morocco,"" the statement said.
""Our principal concern at the moment is to provide love and support to their four sons who have had to suffer the loss of both a mother and a father in swift succession.
""The boys are being well cared for by relatives.
""We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the British consular authorities in Morocco for their invaluable assistance.""
The mayor of Pershore, John Grantham, said people who knew the couple had been saddened by the news.
He said: ""They're clearly very upset, it's been quite a shock.""

"Vaughan Gething said he was ""looking again at charging arrangements"" for people from countries without reciprocal arrangements with the UK.
In a new BBC Wales poll, 79% of those surveyed said they would increase charges for visitors from outside the UK for using the health service.
But Mr Gething said such charges were a ""marginal area"" of NHS activity.
Speaking to The Wales Report on Wednesday, he said: ""We have reciprocal arrangements with most European countries, and as long as those reciprocal arrangements work I see no reason to intervene and change those.
""However for people outside the UK and Europe where we don't have those, we're looking again at charging arrangements.""
""Later in the year I'll get to make a decision on what charging may or may not look like.""
But the health secretary added: ""This is such a marginal area of activity.""
""Really, when you're talking about the central funding of the health service, with the big challenge that we face, the actual conversation about charging people from abroad is an absolute distraction.""
Asked whether he would consider charging patients who have illnesses caused by their lifestyle choices, Mr Gething said: ""If you're really saying, for example, that someone with lung cancer who smoked should therefore be charged for their treatment.
""I actually think that when you get into real examples like that, people will very quickly say that isn't what I think should happen.
""When you think about the practical reality of it, it isn't that simple at all.""
Mr Gething warned while the Welsh Government had made ""significant additional commitments"" to the health service from its budget, there would be difficult consequences if austerity continues across the UK.
""The challenge will be if we don't see the tide turned back on austerity every single part of the UK health service system will face really awful choices, that I don't think the public will tolerate.""","The Welsh Government is reviewing NHS charges for visitors from outside the UK, the health secretary has said.",39131595
"Defeat sees Burton slip to 21st, two points clear of the drop zone, as they lost for the third time in five games.
In a first half of few chances, Damien McCrory and Jamie Ward fired over for the hosts, while Huddersfield's Nahki Wells blazed a free-kick over.
Wells then turned match-winner, heading in Christopher Schindler's knock-back from Aaron Mooy's free-kick.
Huddersfield remain nine points adrift of current leaders Brighton, who won 3-2 at Blackburn, but the Brewers are just a place above the relegation zone as their five-match unbeaten home run in the Championship came to an end.
Ater going close before the break, Ward curled a shot over the bar in the second half.
Huddersfield forward Elias Kachunga saw his goal-bound shot cleared off the line by McCrory as the visitors looked the most likely to score.
But they had to wait until the 85th minute as Mooy's long free-kick was headed back in the box by Schindler and nodded in by Wells for his fifth goal of the season.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:
""We deserved at least a point out of the game. The players were magnificent from start to finish and couldn't give any more.
""We've played well, created chances but just couldn't finish one and then they pop up in the 85th minute.
""We are unlucky not to get the result but we are not disappointed in the performance - it was excellent.""
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
""We can be very happy about the three points. We knew that fighting spirit and working attitude would be very important and this is what they have shown.
""The offensive performance was not our best but this was not the most important thing.

"Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances.
When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media.
His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president.
When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards.
Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky.
Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK.
Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death.
Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption.
He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as ""prisoners of conscience"".
Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges.
Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail.
Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred"" after performing an ""anti-Putin punk prayer"" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal.
Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012.
Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence.
Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences.
Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin.
Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres.
But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents.
Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium.
It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin.
Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011.
Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists.
Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority.
Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as ""negligible"".
Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

"The greatest foreign policy disasters have tended to come when the UK has either ignored America - such as when it joined France in invading Suez - or when it has followed the US too blindly, as in the invasion of Iraq, against the warnings of many in Europe.
Britain has done better when it has played its traditional role as a bridge between the two continents: seeking to manage America's swings between isolationism and interventionism while at the same time reassuring Europe that the US could be more than just a brash Nato ally.
This Atlanticist analysis is, of course, a simplification of a complex relationship, but the point stands: the UK has a unique opportunity by virtue of its history and geography to bring the US and Europe together, not take sides. And yet the election of Donald Trump risks doing just that, driving a wedge between Britain and the EU just when both sides need it least.
Since the president-elect's shock election, the British government has staggered, recovered its balance and started making overtures to the emerging administration.
Its public statements have been welcoming and warm. Here is Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's latest description of the president-elect, in a Czech newspaper: ""Donald Trump is dealmaker, he is a guy who believes firmly in values that I believe in too - freedom and democracy. As far as I understand, he is in many aspects a liberal guy from New York.""
This is a long way from the criticisms that he and Prime Minister Theresa May uttered during the campaign. But both are now eating their words without shame, for they believe that it is in the national interest for the government to engage with next president of the United States, whatever his character, temperament and policy agenda.
The prime minister's Guildhall speech - arguing that everyone should benefit from globalisation - may have been designed to show British voters that she has an agenda for change. But it also sent a strong signal to Mr Trump that she understood the forces that led to his election and the shared need for the whole world to address them.
In contrast, some EU countries have worn their hearts on their sleeve and expressed their dissatisfaction at the election of a man whose opinions they find distasteful. This was the context of the emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers this week, which Boris Johnson dismissed as a ""whinge-o-rama"".
Some British diplomats saw the meeting as an attempt by the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, to grandstand and use Mr Trump's election to drive forward her own agenda for more EU defence cooperation.
She was distinctly sarcastic about Mr Johnson's refusal to attend the meeting, saying it was ""normal"" for a country that had decided to leave the EU not to be interested in its relations with the US.
As if that were not enough, Mr Johnson also clashed with his EU counterparts over Turkey, urging them not to lecture Ankara over the death penalty. And some EU leaders will not like Mrs May acknowledging the strength of Mr Trump's anti-globalisation arguments just as they prepare to do electoral battle with populist parties flying the same anti-establishment flag.
So on the face of it, Britain is falling out with Europe over Mr Trump just when its overwhelming foreign policy objective should be preparing the way for Brexit, working closely with European allies to find the areas of common ground where a potential deal could be done. This should be a time for cool diplomacy, not hot-headed spats over who is going to which meeting.
And all this before the tough decisions come. Responding to an election is one thing. It is quite another to choose sides when there are real policy dilemmas on the table.
What happens if Mr Trump makes overtures to Russia and calls for sanctions over Ukraine to be reduced? What happens if Mr Trump ends US support for Syrian rebels and orders the US military to join forces with Russia against the Islamic State group?
This was the one issue of substance Messrs Trump and Putin discussed in their telephone call this week. And what happens if Mr Trump is true to his word and reduces the US commitment to Nato? All of these are policy choices that could see the UK not only reverse longstanding positions but also place itself at odds with either the US or the EU.
This is the context for Mrs May's trip to Berlin on Friday where she will meet President Obama and four of her most important European counterparts, from Germany, France , Italy and Spain. The challenge for this untested, newly appointed prime minister will be to walk that traditional fine line between the US and Europe.
She has to prepare the way for these tough policy decisions, urging Europe to engage with a president-elect who cannot be ignored. But equally she will be under some pressure to make it clear to the travelling Americans that Britain will not roll over and accept automatically whatever foreign policy emerges from a Trump-led Washington.
The UK-US relationship is hardly special at the moment. Mr Trump has shown no hesitation at embarrassing Mrs May by giving Nigel Farage a photo-opportunity at Trump Towers, giving the impression that the UKIP leader is filling a vacuum left by the Foreign Office.
Mr Obama has chosen to visit Greece and Germany and not the UK on a valedictory European tour and in a news conference described Chancellor Merkel as ""probably... my closest international partner these eight years"".
In vain did David Cameron flip those burgers in the Downing Street garden with the president. As the one time US Secretary of State Dean Acheson once wrote: ""Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America... but unique did not mean affectionate.""
So the task now for the British government is to engage with Mr Trump's incipient administration and do what it can - if anything - to shape and influence his foreign policy before firm positions are established.
Officials recognise there is a window of opportunity in the coming weeks that should not be wasted that could set the terms for discussions about trade and security. Mrs May is pushing for an early meeting with Mr Trump before the inauguration in January.
The Foreign Office is already holding talks with the Trump team about the possibility of Mr Johnson travelling to Washington to meet the Vice-President-elect, Mike Pence, and potentially others in the Trump team in the next few weeks. Officials insist that these discussions began before Mr Farage began claiming his ambassadorial role with Mr Trump.
But at the same time, the government also has to ensure that this process of engagement with the US does not make Brexit harder by losing what little political support it still has in Europe's chancelleries.
The former Chancellor George Osborne told ITV this week that Britain's focus should be on Europe. ""For the first time really, the most important decisions over the next few years are going to be about our relationship with Europe, not about our relationship with the United States,"" he said.
In the past few months, the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump have overturned many of Britain's traditional foreign policy assumptions.
The government needs to repair relations with both the US and the EU while not antagonising both in process.
Falling between the two geopolitical stools would leave the UK floundering mid-Atlantic without a paddle.","In the arc of history, Britain has rarely flourished when it has had to choose between Europe and the United States.",37989821
"But are there limits to how far authenticity can take a politician?
During the course of his campaign Donald Trump has made statements that mainstream politicians would consider disastrous gaffes, alienating important parts of the electorate.
""When Mexico sends its people,"" Trump told an audience in Arizona, ""they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists...""
It was a remark bound to alienate Hispanic voters. But others liked Trump for saying what he thinks.
One recent poll shows him having 24% support for the Republican nomination - well ahead of second-placed Jeb Bush's 11%.
One of Trump's key messages is that he is so rich that no one can buy him.
Jeremy Corbyn, who has a record as one of the Labour Party's most rebellious MPs, argues that while many of his colleagues duck and weave, he is an honourable man committed to core principles on which he will not compromise.
His ability to pack halls with huge crowds suggest it's a message that has great resonance.
In Europe - especially in southern countries hit hard by the financial crisis - some insurgent politicians have broken through.
Historically most European populist parties - which generally pit the people against a self-serving elite - have been on the right.
But in recent years the left too has produced Spain's Podemas and in Greece, Syriza, which went from a protest party to forming the government, taking on the bureaucrats in Brussels.
In the last UK general election Nigel Farage's UKIP won support by arguing that it was prepared to confront issues that the Westminster politicians were trying to dodge.
And in Scotland the SNP swept to power, partly by running against what the party portrayed as a privileged and remote political establishment in London.
There are a number of explanations for the increasing number of people who resent mainstream politicians.
As well as a long-term fall in the levels of deference, sceptics point to spin doctors, focus groups, heavily managed public appearances and mainstream politicians' use of vacuous, scripted language.
Campaign finance scandals also create mistrust.
It is estimated that to run a successful re-election campaign a US senator needs to raise over $14,000 (Â£8,900) every day that he or she is in office.
Aware that they are distrusted, some politicians try to connect with voters by emoting in public.
When Hilary Clinton was performing worse that expected in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Party primary contest, she broke down in tears on TV.
Analysts at the time said that moment helped her to secure victory in the state.
But even if many mainstream politicians cast an envious glance at colleagues perceived to be authentic, there are limits to conviction politics.
On both sides of the Atlantic the current phases of the electoral cycles means Trump and Corbyn are appealing for support from active party members.
If either win they will face the daunting challenge of broadening their appeal to less politically committed voters.
And even then authenticity does not always produce the results voters are hoping for.
Jose Mujica of Uruguay is generally considered to have been one of the most authentic politicians of modern times.
Having won the presidency in 2010 he turned down the chance to live in the presidential palace, staying instead in his modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo.
A revolutionary fighter who spent over a decade in prison, Mujica stayed true to many of his ideals, giving away 90% of his presidential salary.
Jose Mujica: The world's 'poorest' president
But even some of President Mujica's allies said that their leader's undimmed idealism did not turn into as many practical reforms as they had hoped for.
And for all Mujica's impassioned and heartfelt denunciations of consumerism, most Uruguayans were just as materialistic at the end of his term in office as they were at the start.
Many admire authentic politicians. But those who stay true to their beliefs and manage to win power still face the challenge of turning their ideas into implementable policy.

"The miner said it would sell 27 billion shares at 1p per share. That compares with a share price of 16.25p on Friday.
Its shares have already tumbled 90% this year as it has also struggled to cope with strikes and rising costs.
Lonmin had already stated that its shares would be issued at a ""significant discount"".
Shares in the platinum miner rose nearly 10% to 17.75p in early trade on the London Stock Exchange.
Lonmin will use the cash raised to help secure $370m (£246m) in bank loans which will mature in 2020. Those loans will replace an existing $543m of loans, which are due to be repaid next year.
The company urged shareholders to approve the cash call, saying the injection was crucial to its survival.
It said if shareholders did not approve the rights issue, its lenders would not allow it to refinance its debt.
Platinum prices have fallen by about 22% in the last year.
""The rights issue has been fully underwritten and we hope shareholders vote positively. We firmly believe that the rights issue is in the best interest of our shareholders,"" Lonmin chief executive Ben Magara said in a statement.
The rights issue came as Lonmin reported an annual loss of $2.2bn, compared with a loss of $326m a year earlier.
The majority of its losses came from a $1.5bn impairment charge at its Marikana mine in South Africa, where 34 miners were killed by police during strikes and unrest in 2010.
Miners have been suffering heavily in recent months as a result of lower commodity prices. But Lonmin was also hit hard by another miners' strike in South Africa in 2014.
In July, it announced plans to close or mothball several mine shafts, putting 6,000 jobs at risk.
It said on Monday that about 3,100 people had since left the company.

He has been charged along with 463 others with inciting violence, rioting and sabotage relating to the protests in Cairo.
Mr Halawa appeared in court on Tuesday and told judges that he was innocent and asked to be allowed to return home.
His family has denied claims that Mr Halawa is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest and largest Islamist organisation.
The Egyptian government has declared it a terrorist group, a claim the organisation rejects.

"It is a decision that has been well telegraphed in recent months, with both agency officials and industry chiefs expressing their doubts that all the hardware could be made ready in time.
The aim of the mission is to land a rover on the Red Planet.
Capable of drilling up to 2m below the surface, it would search for signs of past or present life.
It is the second part of the so-called ExoMars programme. The first part - a satellite to study the atmosphere of the planet - was launched successfully in March and should arrive in October.
But the surface robot will now follow four years behind, instead of two (planetary alignment dictates that the most efficient  launch opportunities become available at 26-month intervals).
The announcement of the launch slip was issued by the European Space Agency (Esa) on Monday.
Russian engineers have been struggling for a while to keep their design for the vehicle's landing mechanism on the 2018 timeline, and in Europe, too, some components and instruments were considered to have very little margin in their development schedule.
A ""tiger team"" set up by Esa and the Russian space agency (Roscosmos), and which included European and Russian industries, could find no solutions to recover lost time.
Rolf de Groot is head of Esa's Robotic Exploration Coordination Office. He told BBC News: ""It is not only the components of the spacecraft; it's several of the instruments.
""What we have been doing lately is seeing if we could shorten the assembly, integration and testing (AIT) phase to something that would be acceptable from a risk point of view, but still make the 2018 launch.
""Very recently, we have concluded that this is not possible without adding a large amount of additional risk to an already risky mission. So, we decided the only responsible thing to do was move to the 2020 launch date.""
For European scientists and engineers who have been working on the rover concept, such delay has become part and parcel of the endeavour.
First envisaged as a small technology demonstration mission, the robot vehicle was approved by European nations back in 2005, with a launch first pencilled in for 2011.
Then, as ambitions grew and the design was beefed up, the start date was put back. At first, it was shifted to 2013, but further problems saw slippage to 2016, and then again to 2018.
At the root of the ExoMars rover's problems has been the lack of a full and proper budget to carry it through. At one stage, in 2009, Esa decided to join forces with America to try to make it happen, only to see Nasa walk away three years later when its priorities changed.
That could have killed the project there and then, but for an offer from the Russians to fill the partnership position vacated by the US.
Nonetheless, as events have now shown, there has been insufficient time to recast the mission.
And the money issue has not gone away. Indeed, it now becomes a bigger problem.
Already, there is a shortfall in the required budget for the rover on the European side. With the additional delay of two years, this deficit only increases.
Esa and the two biggest European space companies - Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space - are in the final stages of agreeing a price to build rover. They are at odds over the figure in euros, but the aim is to get the negotiations done before a meeting of member state delegations in June.
It is at this council gathering that Esa officials will set out a new path for the project. One intention is to continue apace with European preparations, and then store all hardware for a year before the last stages of AIT. This would mitigate some of the additional costs that come from maintaining large teams.
The two nations most invested in ExoMars are Italy and the UK, with Britain charged with assembling the rover.
Airbus Defence and Space has recently built a cleanroom at its Stevenage facilities north of London to perform this task.
If there is one positive to come out of the delay it is that the list of potential landing sites will now lengthen.
The particular flight parameters of a 2019 arrival at Mars limited the rover to really only one destination - Oxia Planum.
An arrival two years later opens up the possibility of reaching other targets of high science interest.

"The tech companies will help design the subsea cable which will run between Virginia in the US and Bilbao, Spain.
The project will be managed by Spanish telecommunications firm Telefonica, which will sell any unused capacity on the cable to other customers.
The cable will help the tech giants move data more quickly and cheaply between their global data centres.
Tech companies typically have to pay telecommunications firms to use their cables, which can be costly. And the large amounts of data moving across those lines can make them slower.
The project, called MAREA, will be the highest-capacity sub-sea cable across the Atlantic, with an expected capacity of some 160 terabits per second of data, the companies said.
It is not the first subsea cable to be sponsored by a tech company.
In 2014 Google paired up with five telecommunications firms to build a subsea cable across the Pacific Ocean.
Construction of the 6,600km (4,125 miles) long cable is due to start in August and is scheduled to be completed in October 2017.
Microsoft said MAREA will help boost the speed and reliability of its cloud services.
""This marks an important new step in building the next generation infrastructure of the internet,"" said Microsoft's director of global network acquisition, Frank Rey.
Microsoft has also been testing underwater data centres. These centres would be cheaper to maintain because they would not have the associated cooling costs of data centres on land and could be powered through marine energy.

"Kjell Lindgren played Amazing Grace on the pipes after recording a message about research scientist Victor Hurst, who was involved in astronaut training.
It is thought to be the first time that bagpipes have been played in space.
They were made for Mr Lindgren by McCallum Bagpipes at the company's factory in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.
Kenny Macleod, who works at McCallum Bagpipes, told BBC Scotland the 42-year-old astronaut had got in touch two years ago to say he was going to the space station and wanted to play the pipes while he was there.
""He wondered if it was feasible to play bagpipes,"" he said.
""They're made of plastic - they're just easier to keep clean and to make sure they're not contaminated. They're also lighter.""
In the video, Mr Lindgren is seen to give the pipes a punch before he starts playing. Mr Macleod said it was normal for pipers to massage the bag to get the air flowing, ""but not quite as vigorously as that"".
""The thing about bagpipes is that they're very difficult to play at high altitude because the air is that bit thinner. They're quite hard to blow so he's done well,"" he added.
There are six astronauts currently in space on the 45th expedition to the International Space Centre.
In a video recorded in the last few days, Mr Lindgren said all of them had come into contact with Dr Hurst during their training and were ""shocked and saddened"" to hear about his death.
Dr Hurst worked for US engineering company Wyle Science as a research scientist and instructor. He died suddenly in October, aged 48.

I don't know if anyone was more enthusiastic and professional about being involved in human space flight.""",A US astronaut has played a set of Scottish-made bagpipes on the International Space Station to pay tribute to a colleague who died.,34757254
"In a statement in the official Granma newspaper, the government described the project as ""a serious error"".
""The symbols of the Revolution are and will always be sacred,"" it read.
The colognes - Ernesto and Hugo - were unveiled on Thursday by a state laboratory in the capital, Havana.
Labiofam said Ernesto, the cologne named after the Argentine-born revolutionary who helped Fidel Castro take over in Cuba in 1959, would be a woodsy and refreshing citric scent with notes of talcum powder.
Hugo, named after the late Venezuelan president, would offer a softer, fruitier fragrance with hints of mango and papaya.
""They will be very attractive colognes, but the names also mean a lot to us,"" said Isabel Gonzalez, vice-president for research and development for Labiofam during the launch.
But the project was mocked in the social networks and criticised by supporters of the Cuban Revolution, who considered it disrespectful.
Labiofam had been in the process of developing stylised bottles and labels for the products before putting them on sale in Cuba and overseas.
""We didn't want to create propaganda, but rather pay homage to them and help their names endure,"" said Cuban biochemist Mario Valdes, who led the scent design team, on Thursday.
The company said it had obtained the agreement of the families of Che Guevara and Hugo Chavez to use their names in the colognes. But that has now been denied by the Cuban government.
""The details of this irresponsible action were discussed in detail on Friday with the company's director and the employees who presented the products, which were still being developed,"" read the statement of the Executive Committee of the Ministers' Council, headed by Cuban President Raul Castro.
""The appropriate measures will be taken to deal with this serious error.

"It follows a successful bid to part-fund construction of the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) on the Christie Hospital site in Withington.
The £35m facility will work on developing personalised cancer treatments for thousands of patients across the UK.
A university spokesman said the announcement was a ""fantastic boost"".
Chris Cox, the university's director of development, said the research centre would translate discoveries made in the laboratory into new treatments.
He said it would house 150 additional researchers who will be developing new ideas and treatments.
Research will focus on radiation therapy, lung cancer, women's cancers, melanoma and haematological oncology.
The centre is the result of a partnership between The University of Manchester, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust and Cancer Research UK.
The Christie's chief executive Caroline Shaw said the funding would ""help facilitate groundbreaking research right here in Manchester"".
""The MCRC is a major step forward that will maximise our potential to benefit not just cancer patients on our doorstep but across the world.""

"BBC Sport takes a look at five things you might have missed in the EFL on the last full match day before the festive season.
There were six late winning goals in the Championship on Saturday, all with ramifications in the race for promotion and the bid to avoid relegation.
Brighton's Glenn Murray headed home in the fifth minute of stoppage time against Birmingham City to ensure the Seagulls will spend Christmas eight points clear of third-placed Reading.
Jaap Stam's men had looked like having to settle for a point at Blackburn before George Evans hit an injury-time winner to move them back up to third.
Yorkshire rivals Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday ensured they would spend Christmas in the top six thanks to winners in the 89th minute and stoppage time against Brentford and Rotherham respectively.
Meanwhile, 23rd-placed Wigan were set to take a point from their home game against Ipswich before David McGoldrick popped up with an 88th-minute winner for Mick McCarthy's men.
Match of the day in the second tier must go to Barnsley's 4-3 win at Cardiff. The Bluebirds led in the third minute before trailing 3-1 at half-time.
Peter Whittingham and Antony Pilkington's 89th-minute strike seemed to have given Neil Warnock's side an unlikely point but Ryan Williams scored in the fifth minute of injury time to make it a happy journey back to South Yorkshire for the Tykes.
Well, maybe not quite miracles but it's probably fair to say neither Wes Brown nor Isaiah Osbourne would have been fancied by many to get on the scoresheet today.
Former Manchester United and Sunderland man Brown, 37, scored on his Blackburn Rovers debut to level the match against the Royals.
It counted for nothing in the end thanks to Reading's late winner but it was Brown's first goal since netting for Sunderland in December 2011.
Walsall midfielder Osbourne only had to wait a shade over three years to end his scoring drought.
The ex-Aston Villa player opened his account for the Saddlers to give them a point against Bradford City.
He'll probably be pleased this goal meant a little more than his last one which opened the scoring for Blackpool against Derby in December 2013. The Rams went on to win 5-1.
Yeovil boss Darren Way, assistant Terry Skiverton and the 18-strong match-day squad put £300 behind the bar at Carlisle as a 'thank you' to fans for making the long trek north.
""Special mention must go to the supporters because how far they've travelled to watch this game is unbelievable commitment,"" Way told BBC Somerset.
""This is beyond the end of the Earth. I just hope they feel that the players gave everything and they can be proud of their team.""
Travelling Glovers fans certainly seemed appreciative as they tweeted the club with pictures of pies and pints.
Sadly for the 96 Yeovil fans who made the 660-mile round trip to Brunton Park, the hosts were not in such a generous mood, with the Cumbrians claiming a 2-1 win.
Roll the clock back to 27 September and Bury are celebrating their sixth league win of the season and sit second in League One.
The following 16 games have brought a sum total of zero victories and the Shakers have slumped into the relegation zone.
David Flitcroft was sacked after presiding over seven consecutive league defeats but replacement Chris Brass, given the job until the end of the season on Thursday, has fared little better, losing his first five matches.
Bury twice took the lead at home to Oxford on Saturday but were pegged back on each occasion by a Chris Maguire free-kick before a Greg Leigh own goal gave the U's victory.
""We've got to dig in and fight a little bit harder than we are right now to keep the ball out of the net,"" Brass told BBC Radio Manchester.
It's been a tough start to the season for Exeter City and their match-going regulars.
Going into today's game against Mansfield, the Grecians had claimed a healthy seven wins away from home but were the only team in the EFL yet to taste success on their own turf.
Paul Tisdale's side ended their wait for a win at St James Park, which dated back to April, with a 2-0 win over the Stags thanks to a double from Ollie Watkins.
""I'm delighted,"" Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon. ""It had to come at some point and we did it today. It was hard work and the boys have deserved it against a really strong team.
""They put us under pressure in the second half and in many respects outplayed us but we stuck to it and 2-0 is a great feeling.""

West Ham manager Slaven Bilic questioned Dean's decision to send off Sofiane Feghouli in his side's 2-0 defeat by Manchester United on Monday.
It was the fifth red card Dean has shown in 15 matches this season.
The Hammers are appealing against Feghouli's dismissal.
Dean sent off the Algeria international midfielder after just 15 minutes following his collision with Phil Jones, but Bilic felt the United defender had committed the more dangerous tackle.

"Glory and grounding. Fight for medals, learn your craft. The stage marries pressure of the here and now with a gateway to a professional future.
British fighters know the pathway only too well - consider 2008 Olympians James DeGale and Billy Joe Saunders, both now professional world champions.
The latest off that conveyor belt, IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, thinks Britain has a ""unique"" fighter waiting to make the transition to the pro ranks.
Here, with the help of Joshua, former Olympic bronze medallist and WBC super-middleweight champion Richie Woodhall, and BBC Radio 5 live pundit Steve Bunce, we take a look at the decisions facing Great Britain's 2016 Olympians.
Super-heavyweight Joe Joyce will leave the comforts of the state-of-the-art British Boxing training base in Sheffield as an Olympic silver medallist, braced for life as a pro, dreaming of emulating the success of previous gold medal winners in his weight class Wladimir Klitschko, Lennox Lewis and Joshua himself.
""Joe Joyce is unique,"" says Joshua of the fighter who holds a degree in fine arts.
""He's very intelligent, he's experienced different things, you can see he is a really solid athlete. He has got people eating out of his hand. He has so much energy.""
Joyce, 30, is quietly spoken to the cameras but ultra-confident in the ring. A competitive swagger perhaps supported by 2014 Commonwealth Games gold and European Games gold in 2015.
He didn't start boxing until he was 22, following a chance introduction to the sport while at university. He is also a part-time model and unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in the James Bond film, Spectre.
""He is most suited to turn pro out of the 12 in the GB squad at this time,"" says Woodhall, who turned pro after the Commonwealth Games in 1990. ""At his age, his engine is more developed. I say that from my own experience as I recall how I felt at say 22 compared to when I was Joe's age. My fitness was more developed for the 12 rounds.""
'Adams could set the pro game alight and get it to the same level as the men's' - 5 Live In Short
Joyce is the oldest male fighter in the British squad. Time is of the essence if he is to attain the Las Vegas dreams those in the fight game seem to universally harbour.
The pro move fascinates, we seem to obsess over it. At virtually every news conference in Rio came the question ""will you now turn pro?""
In June, the contentious decision was made to allow professionals to compete. However, it is not as simple as it may seem with the IBF stating in advance of the Rio Games that any boxer competing in Brazil would be stripped of their title.
The IBF claimed it was a safety risk for professionals to face amateurs.
""If I'm to be perfectly honest, I don't think there's anyone apart from Joyce that's ready for the pro game because they are all very young,"" added Woodhall, who works with GB's amateurs twice a week.
""The more international experience you have in amateur or Olympic boxing, the better you are prepared for the pro game because you are experiencing so many styles of fighter. Too many of our amateurs turn pro far too soon.""
Six of the seven male British fighters from London 2012 have now had a pro bout. Britain's Rio 2016 elite were a fresh crop, delivering three medals as a squad, while Cuba led the way in the ring with six.
""The Cubans, the Kazakhs, the Russians, the Ukrainians, they all keep their guys from four years ago,"" said Bunce. ""It's quite absurd. If only we could keep ours, persuade them not to go chasing the money, the money will be there [in the future].""
Promoters may promise big fights, big cheques, progression to domestic and world titles, yada, yada. The amateur game can sometimes be painted as a poor relation, not the sacred test many would argue it is.
A Team GB fighter can earn up to £28,000 a year in basic funding. They can have food, physio and costs of living four days a week in camp covered, while training at a centre often visited by rival nations on research missions, such is its standing.
""When you turn pro you're funding yourself, you become your own boss,"" added Joshua, gold medallist at London 2012.
""You have to find a nutritionist, a physio, training grounds and it all comes at a cost. You have to look at the whole idea of being left to your own devices and finding good people to work with.
""You have to look at the system that made you successful and try to use it as a professional.""
Life on the other side offers an allure often too strong to resist, but there can be struggles. Audley Harrison - Olympic super heavyweight champion in 2000 - found pro life tough, Luke Campbell has tasted defeat in the paid ranks. Gold medals do not stop punches.
But Joshua's 30-month march from pro debut to heavyweight champion provides hope of glorious transition. He remains the only class of 2012 fighter to even contest a world title. Will the bright lights among which he now lives come calling for the 2016 team?
""He's made for the pro game,"" says Bunce of Joshua Buatsi, a bronze medallist at light heavyweight in Rio.
Buatsi - still only 23 - displayed knockout power in Brazil. The St Mary's University student showed desire for a finish rather that the point-snatching style which historically shines in Olympic boxing.
""He fights like a pro,"" Bunce added. ""These Olympics have been more pro minded than any Olympics since 1980. These guys are having rows. The new scoring system means a return to old style blood, guts and thunder Olympic boxing which anyone above the age of 35 will remember falling in love with when they were younger.""
Buatsi could fall in love with offers from promoters post-Rio, although Joyce is still the only GB fighter to state he will certainly go over.
Woodhall hopes for an amateur stay for the Ghana-born fighter, who claims Floyd Mayweather said he was ""a future world champion"" during a chance meeting in Rio.
""To win bronze here with the international experience he has had which is very little, then another four years into Joshua Buatsi and you'd probably see him winning gold,"" added Woodhall.
So have we seen our Anthony Joshua moment at Rio 2016? Have we seen a star born?
The desire is there but how greedy are we? Great Britain is home to 14 world champions. British Boxing did not choose 12 fighters to go to Rio, they delivered 12 for a maximum of 13 spaces in tough qualifying. These are heady times.
Nicola Adams did what Nicola Adams does to take gold and eight of the 10 male fighters in Brazil were under the age of 25.
""We hit our medal target and should retain our funding,"" added Woodhall. ""There's more to come from this team. I'm pretty sure we will win more than three medals in Tokyo.""
Joshua added: ""I think the guys that didn't manage to medal gained valuable experience and if they stay on until Tokyo we will see these guys shine.""
It may hurt British Boxing bosses a little to see only Adams, Buatsi, Joyce and Savannah Marshall progress past the last-16 stage, but young fighters will ""develop power and learn from mistakes"" as their journey progresses, according to Joshua.
So switch now, or soak up more knowledge?
Bunce added: ""All 10 of the men will win British titles. As many as six or seven will end up winning a version of the world title.""
That's expectation and with it comes pressure. We wait to see if anyone can reach greatness from boxing's Olympic springboard.","Sugar Ray Leonard, Floyd Mayweather, Gennady Golovkin and even the great Muhammad Ali used the Olympic Games as a springboard for boxing superstardom.",37147580
"University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust was rated as inadequate in an inspection by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
It said the Royal Lancaster Infirmary and Furness General Hospital in Barrow needed to improve the quality of care.
The trust said it was ""part-way through a process of significant improvement"".
Last year, a separate trust covering the north of the county, North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust, was one of 11 put into special measures after the Keogh review found higher-than-expected mortality rates.
The CQC inspection took place in February and while inspectors said care in services such as maternity and A&E had improved since previous checks, they added other areas of concern had not been addressed.
Medical care in one part of the Royal Lancaster was said to be ""of particular concern"".
The overall recruitment of nurses and doctors was identified as a ""fundamental"" worry with ""too much reliance"" on temporary staff.
The chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, said: ""There is a long history of concern with the quality of service provided by the trust, so it is disappointing to report that a number of the issues that have been identified in the past remain unresolved.
""I do not believe that the trust is likely to resolve its challenges without external support.""
As well as the hospitals in Barrow and Lancaster, inspectors also visited the Westmorland General Hospital, near Kendal, which was said to be providing a good service overall.
The trust's chief executive, Jackie Daniel said: ""The reports reflect the fact we are part-way through a process of significant improvement which is still going to take a number of years to complete.
""It isn't an overnight job to change the culture of a large, complex organisation.""
Full reports of the inspection have been published on the CQC website.","A failing health trust has been placed in special measures, meaning all Cumbria hospital trusts are now getting extra help to boost performance.",28023415

"The project was launched in Grenada by the prince, who is on a 15-day tour of the Caribbean.
Nine places are available on the six-week Royal Household Hospitality Scholarship initiative.
Training could include shadowing a service team at official events.
Successful applicants to the programme will be attached to the Master of the Household's department, which looks after all planning and entertaining given by the Queen, both official and private, in the UK and overseas.
It also provides support to the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and other royal family members.
The training could range from learning complex chocolate and sugar craft or performing duties for the Queen's guests at Windsor Castle during Royal Ascot week.
Candidates to the scholarship programme can apply from the nine Caribbean countries where the Queen is head of state which include Jamaica, Grenada and St Lucia.
Successful candidates will be provided with staff accommodation in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace, as well as meals and travel. Flights will be provided by their home realm.
Meanwhile, Prince Harry praised a drawing of himself created by a teenager during a visit to an exhibition of environmental and social projects on Grenada's Grand Anse beach in the capital St George's.
The prince chatted to the artist Richie Modeste, 18, who was being supported by a organisation which helps disadvantaged young people, and told him the artwork was ""amazing"".
The prince asked the teenager: ""How long have you been drawing for?"" and when the young artist replied ""for about six years now"" he praised his efforts, saying: ""You have a serious talent.""
Later, Prince Harry took a 10-minute ride in a glass-bottomed boat to see gardeners tending an underwater nursery that environmentalists hope help will produce coral to be transplanted to damaged reefs.
The prince presented a handwritten postcard message of support for the project which said: ""Globally 75% of coral reefs are under threat from over-fishing, habitat destruction, pollution and acidification of the sea due to climate change.
""It is fantastic to see Grenada doing their bit for their surrounding ocean and coral reefs. We must protect the things that give us so much.""",Budding hospitality workers from the Caribbean will have the chance to train at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle under a scholarship programme announced by Prince Harry.,38139638
